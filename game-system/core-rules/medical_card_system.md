# ATOMIC TOMORROW: MEDICAL CARD SYSTEM

## CORE CONCEPT

Medical treatment uses the same card-driven approach as research and repair, but with injury-specific restrictions. Unlike other systems where you can switch approaches, medical treatment is **diagnosis-locked** - a trauma injury requires trauma treatment throughout the healing process.

## SUIT SPECIALIZATIONS

- **♥️ HEARTS**: Bleeding & Circulation (Internal medicine, blood loss, shock)
- **♣️ CLUBS**: Trauma & Impact (Fractures, lacerations, penetrating wounds)  
- **♠️ SPADES**: Toxins & Disease (Poisons, infections, pathogens, radiation sickness)
- **♦️ DIAMONDS**: Burns & Energy (Heat damage, radiation burns, energy weapon wounds)

## INJURY RESOLUTION PHASES

### 1. INITIAL DIAGNOSIS
When a character receives wounds, determine the **injury type** based on the cause:
- **Snake bite/poison gas/radiation**: Spades (Toxins & Disease)
- **Blaster/heat ray/fire**: Diamonds (Burns & Energy)  
- **Gunshot/blade/impact**: Clubs (Trauma & Impact)
- **Internal bleeding/shock**: Hearts (Bleeding & Circulation)

### 2. TREATMENT SEQUENCE
Draw cards **one at a time** normally. Compare each card's value to the **current card being treated**:

**Primary Suit Cards** (based on injury type):
- Must accumulate Treatment Points equal to card value to clear
- Each cleared primary card converts 1 Wound to 1 Strain

**Secondary Cards** (other suits) create outcomes based on value comparison:

**HIGHER VALUE** = *Positive Response*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Patient stabilizes - recover 1 strain immediately  
- **♣️ Clubs**: Treatment going smoothly - gain +1 Treatment Point toward current card
- **♠️ Spades**: No infection - immune to infection complications for rest of treatment
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Equipment working perfectly - next Medicine check at +20%

**EXACT MATCH** = *Perfect Response*
- Any suit: Immediately clear 1 strain (if any) AND gain +2 Treatment Points

**LOWER VALUE** = *Complications*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Patient instability - Make GRIT check or go into shock
- **♣️ Clubs**: Physical setback - Choose: spend 1 MSU or gain 1 strain  
- **♠️ Spades**: Infection risk - Make Medicine check or draw 1 Spades card later
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Equipment malfunction - Spend 1 Energy Unit or -10% to Medicine checks

**Example**: Currently treating 3♦ (burn treatment)
- Draw 8♣: Higher value! Treatment going smoothly, gain +1 Treatment Point
- Draw 3♥: Exact match! Clear 1 strain AND gain +2 Treatment Points  
- Draw 2♠: Lower value! Infection risk complication

### 3. SKILL-BASED TREATMENT
Progress through cards using Treatment Points accumulated from Medicine checks:
- **Critical Success**: 3 Treatment Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Treatment Points  
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Treatment Point

**EXTRA SUCCESS OPTIONS**: When you get Special or Critical Success, excess Treatment Points can be spent as:
- **Standard**: Extra points toward clearing current card
- **FORESIGHT**: Reveal next card without drawing it (1 point per peek)
- **PREVENTION**: Discard a future card before it happens (1 points per discard)

**Tactical Advantages**:
- High-skill medics can spot trouble coming and take preventive action
- Spend resources now to avoid complications later
- Plan treatment approach based on what's coming next

## MEDICAL "MOVES" - PLAYER OPTIONS

### BASIC TREATMENT
**TREAT CURRENT CARD**
- Roll appropriate Medicine skill vs. card value
- Accumulate Treatment Points until card is cleared
- Choose: Draw next card OR stop treatment here

**STOP TREATMENT**
- Can halt treatment after clearing any card, revealed but not executed cards take effect now. (If you stop when you see an infection risk upcoming, the risk doesn't go away.)
- Remaining wounds still impose penalties and incapacitation risk
- Allows triage decisions and resource conservation

### RESOURCE EXPENDITURE OPTIONS

**SPEND MEDICAL SUPPLIES (MSU)**
- Cost: 1 MSU per Treatment Point gained
- Effect: Automatic progress without rolling
- Limitation: Maximum 3 MSU per card

**SPEND TIME (Extended Care)**
- Cost: 2 hours per auto-clear
- Effect: Automatically clear any card of value 4 or less
- Limitation: Patient must be stable (not critical condition)

**EMERGENCY INTERVENTION**
- Cost: 2 MSU + Medicine check at -20%
- Effect: Immediately clear current card regardless of value
- Risk: Special/Critical failure causes secondary complications

### STRATEGIC OPTIONS

**DIAGNOSTIC SCAN**
- Cost: 1 MSU or 30 minutes examination
- Effect: Look at the next card in the sequence without drawing it
- Limitation: Once per treatment sequence

**ALTERNATIVE APPROACH**
- Cost: 1 hour + successful Science/Chemistry check
- Effect: Discard current card and draw a new one from the same suit
- Risk: New card might be worse than the original
- Limitation: Can only be used on number cards (not face cards)

**STABILIZATION PROTOCOL**
- Cost: 1 MSU + successful Medicine check
- Effect: Skip the current card and draw the next one
- Trade-off: Skipped complication becomes chronic (recurring issue)
- Limitation: Cannot be used on face cards

**TRIAGE PROTOCOL**
- Cost: 1 action per additional patient
- Effect: Can maintain treatment on multiple patients simultaneously
- Limitation: -20% to all Medicine checks while managing multiple patients
- Benefit: Prevents untreated patients from deteriorating

**FIELD AMPUTATION**
- Requirement: Clubs (trauma) injury affecting limb
- Cost: 2 MSU + Medicine (Surgical) check
- Effect: Immediately clear all remaining Clubs cards for that injury
- Trade-off: Patient loses limb but avoids death/complications
- Atomic Age Gloss: "Sometimes you gotta choose between the limb and the life, doc!"

**COMBAT STIMS**
- Cost: 1 MSU per use
- Effect: Patient can ignore wound penalties for 1 hour
- Risk: When stims wear off, make GRIT check or gain 1 additional strain
- Limitation: Each additional dose increases crash risk

**JURY-RIG TREATMENT**
- Requirement: No proper medical supplies available
- Effect: Use improvised materials (liquor, spare parts, etc.)
- Mechanics: All Treatment Points cost double, but no MSU expenditure
- Atomic Age Gloss: "Pass me that atomic battery and some space-whiskey!"

**QUARANTINE FIELD**
- Cost: 1 Energy Unit + Science check
- Effect: Isolate Spades (toxin/disease) injuries to prevent spread
- Benefit: Other characters immune to contagion from this patient
- Duration: Until treatment completed or field generator fails

**NEURAL BLOCK**
- Cost: 1 MSU + Medicine (Pharmaceutical) check
- Effect: Patient unconscious but stable - cannot deteriorate further
- Trade-off: Cannot continue treatment until block wears off (4 hours)
- Use: Buy time when overwhelmed or lacking supplies

### COLLABORATIVE OPTIONS

**SPECIALIST CONSULTATION**
- Requirement: Second character with relevant skill
- Effect: Reroll any failed Treatment check once per card
- Limitation: Consultant cannot assist on subsequent cards

**SURGICAL TEAM**
- Requirement: Assistant with Medicine or relevant technical skill
- Effect: Reduce all card values by 1 (minimum 2)
- Duration: Entire treatment sequence

**COMBAT MEDIC PROTOCOL**
- Requirement: Treat under fire or time pressure
- Effect: Convert any card to Hearts suit (bleeding/shock focus)
- Trade-off: +20% difficulty on all rolls

## FACE CARD COMPLICATIONS

### JACKS (Treatment Complications)
- **♥️ Heart Jack - Hemorrhage**: Patient losing blood; GRIT check or suffer additional wound
- **♣️ Club Jack - Compound Fracture**: Bone fragments causing tissue damage
- **♠️ Spade Jack - Toxic Reaction**: Allergic response to treatment; switch to alternative approach
- **♦️ Diamond Jack - Tissue Necrosis**: Damaged tissue spreading; immediate surgical intervention required

### QUEENS (Critical Decisions)
- **♥️ Heart Queen - Cardiac Arrest**: Emergency resuscitation; success saves patient, failure = death
- **♣️ Club Queen - Emergency Surgery**: Must choose between saving limb or saving life
- **♠️ Spade Queen - Organ Failure**: Requires rare antidote or cybernetic replacement
- **♦️ Diamond Queen - Radiation Cascade**: Cellular damage spreading; experimental treatment required

### KINGS (Major Interventions)
- **♥️ Heart King - Transfusion**: Requires compatible blood donor or synthetic substitute
- **♣️ Club King - Reconstructive Surgery**: Requires surgical bay and 8+ hour procedure
- **♠️ Spade King - Quarantine Protocol**: Patient infectious; treat in isolation or risk spread
- **♦️ Diamond King - Cybernetic Integration**: Damage too severe; requires artificial replacement

## WOUND RECOVERY MECHANICS

**SUCCESSFUL CARD CLEARANCE**
- Each cleared card converts 1 Wound to 1 Strain
- Strain represents fatigue/pain rather than injury
- Strain recovers naturally (1 per day of rest)

**STIMULANT TREATMENT**
- Cost: 1 MSU per Strain addressed
- Effect: Immediately remove Strain penalties
- Risk: Potential crash effects (GRIT check after 4 hours)

**STABILIZATION VS. HEALING**
- **Stabilization**: Stop bleeding/prevent death (clear Hearts cards first)
- **Structural Repair**: Fix broken bones/torn tissue (clear Clubs cards)
- **Detoxification**: Neutralize poisons (clear Spades cards)  
- **Burn Treatment**: Repair energy damage (clear Diamonds cards)

## FIELD MEDICINE LIMITATIONS

**TRIAGE DECISIONS**
When treating multiple patients:
- Can only actively treat one card sequence at a time
- Other patients require Stabilization Protocol to prevent deterioration
- Assistants can maintain stabilized patients

**EQUIPMENT RESTRICTIONS**
- **Field Kit**: Can only handle cards of value 6 or less
- **Medical Bay**: No card value restrictions
- **Emergency Conditions**: All card values +2 difficulty

**EXPERTISE SPECIALIZATION**
Different medical specialists gain bonuses with specific suits:
- **Trauma Surgeon**: +20% with Clubs (trauma) cards
- **Toxicologist**: +20% with Spades (poison) cards
- **Radiation Specialist**: +20% with Diamonds (energy) cards
- **Emergency Physician**: +20% with Hearts (bleeding) cards

## EXAMPLE TREATMENT SEQUENCE

**PATIENT**: Shot with ray gun (2 wounds, Diamonds primary)  
**GOAL**: Clear 2 Diamond cards to heal both wounds

**CARD 1 - 7♦**: Primary burn treatment (7 Treatment Points needed)
- Current card value: 7

**CARD 2 - 4♣**: Lower than 7! Treatment going smoothly
- Gain +1 Treatment Point toward the 7♦ (now need only 6 more)
- Medic rolls Medicine, gets 4 points total
- Need 2 more points to clear the 7♦

**CARD 3 - 7♥**: Exact match with current card!
- Clear 1 strain immediately AND gain +2 Treatment Points  
- 7♦ now fully cleared → First wound healed (becomes strain)

**CARD 4 - 3♦**: Next primary burn (3 Treatment Points needed)
- Current card value now: 3

**CARD 5 - 8♠**: Higher than 3! Infection complication
- Make Medicine check to avoid future infection
- **Success**: No additional problems

**CARD 6 - 2♥**: Lower than 3! Patient stabilizing
- Recover 1 strain immediately (patient feeling better!)
- Medic uses Extended Care to auto-clear the simple 3♦

**RESULT**: Both wounds healed, patient has only 1 strain total (instead of 2) due to good responses during treatment!
