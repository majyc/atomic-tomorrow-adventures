# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## TASK RESOLUTION SYSTEM

This system handles non-combat challenges that characters face, from bypassing security systems to performing emergency surgery or deciphering alien artifacts.

## PRINCIPLES

1. **Roll When It Matters**: Only roll when success is uncertain and failure has consequences
2. **Direct Contribution**: All participants contribute directly to tasks rather than providing abstract bonuses
3. **Flexible Timeframes**: Task difficulty and duration are separate considerations
4. **Action Under Pressure**: Tasks can be performed during combat or other time-sensitive situations

## WHEN TO ROLL

Roll only when these conditions are met:

- The task has a meaningful chance of failure
- Failure would have consequences
- The outcome isn't predetermined by the narrative

**Don't Roll For:**

- Opening an unlocked door
- Basic piloting in clear conditions
- Simple communications
- Reading comprehension
- Using basic equipment as intended

## TASK DIFFICULTY

Tasks are categorized by complexity, independent of timeframe:

### Standard Tasks

- Single roll against appropriate skill
- **Examples**: Hot-wiring a vehicle, treating a minor injury, identifying a strange mineral

### Complex Tasks

- Requires 3 successes
- **Examples**: Bypassing security systems, performing field surgery, repairing damaged equipment

### Demanding Tasks

- Requires 5 successes
- **Examples**: Deciphering alien code, disarming complex explosive, hacking a military computer

### Expert Tasks

- Requires 8 successes
- **Examples**: Performing delicate brain surgery, reconstructing ancient technology, navigating a treacherous asteroid field

### Master Tasks

- Requires 12+ successes
- **Examples**: Repairing a severely damaged spacecraft, deciphering an entire alien language, terraforming a small region

## SUCCESS COUNTING

Success quality matters and contributes different amounts toward task completion:

- **Ordinary Success**: Contributes 1 point toward completion
- **Special Success** (roll ending in 0 or 5): Contributes 2 points toward completion
- **Critical Success** (doubles under skill percentage): Contributes 3 points toward completion

## TIMEFRAMES

Timeframes are established separately from difficulty:

### Combat Round (6 seconds)

- One attempt per round
- **Examples**: Bypassing a blast door during combat, stabilizing a critically wounded comrade

### Standard Task (1-5 minutes)

- Frequent checks (every minute)
- **Examples**: Hot-wiring a vehicle, picking a standard lock

### Extended Task (10-60 minutes)

- Checks at meaningful intervals
- **Examples**: Performing surgery, repairing ship systems, interrogating a captive

### Prolonged Effort (Hours to days)

- Checks once per significant time unit
- **Examples**: Surveying a crash site, researching ancient artifacts, constructing a makeshift shelter

## TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION

### Primary and Secondary Contributors

For tasks where one person clearly leads while others assist:

- The primary operator makes normal skill rolls
- Assistants make skill rolls at -20%
- Assistants contribute a maximum of 1 success per roll, regardless of quality
- **Example**: In surgery, the lead surgeon accumulates normal successes while assistants (nurses, anesthesiologists) can contribute at most 1 success per roll

### Distributed Effort

For tasks where multiple people can contribute equally:

- All participants make normal skill rolls
- All successes count normally (1 for ordinary, 2 for special, 3 for critical)
- **Example**: Searching a large area, repairing a starship, constructing defensive positions

### Leadership in Group Tasks

- A character with Leadership skill can make a single roll at the start of a group task
- Success doesn't grant bonuses but instead:
  - On ordinary success: One participant may reroll one failed roll
  - On special success: Two participants may reroll one failed roll each
  - On critical success: All participants may reroll one failed roll
- This represents efficient coordination rather than abstract bonuses

## SUCCESS UNDER PRESSURE

For tasks performed during combat or time-sensitive situations:

### Urgent Tasks

- Character must choose between their normal combat action or one attempt at the task
- Task attempt counts as their action for that round
- **Example**: A security expert trying to bypass a blast door while teammates hold off attackers

### Split Attention

- Character can attempt a task while maintaining awareness, but at -20% to the skill check
- **Example**: An engineer making emergency repairs while watching for enemies

### Rushed Work

- Character can attempt to rush a task that would normally take longer
- Roll at -20% to -40% depending on how much they're rushing
- Complications are more likely
- **Example**: Performing a 1-hour repair job in 15 minutes

## COMPLICATIONS

When failures occur in complex tasks:

### Task Setbacks

- **Minor Setback**: On a special failure (failed roll ending in 0 or 5), lose 1 previously accumulated success
- **Major Setback**: On a critical failure (doubles that fail), lose all accumulated successes and must restart the task

## SAMPLE EXTENDED TASKS

### Breaking Mysterion Encryption (Demanding Task)

- **Success Needed**: 5
- **Skills Used**: Technology (Communications), Computer Systems (Cryptography)
- **Timeframe**: 30 minutes (check every 5 minutes)
- **Collaboration**: Primary/Secondary (one cryptographer with possible assistants)
- **Narration**: "The encrypted message could reveal the Mysterions' next target. You'll need to identify their cipher patterns and break through their security protocols."

### Emergency Repairs During Combat (Complex Task)

- **Success Needed**: 3
- **Skills Used**: Repair (Ship Systems), Engineering (Power Systems)
- **Timeframe**: Combat rounds (one attempt per round)
- **Collaboration**: Distributed (multiple engineers)
- **Narration**: "With the propulsion system damaged and Mysterion saucers closing in, you need to get the engines back online before you're sitting ducks."

### Surviving in the Venusian Jungle (Expert Task)

- **Success Needed**: 8
- **Skills Used**: Survival (Jungle), Science (Xenobiology)
- **Timeframe**: Days (one check per day)
- **Collaboration**: Distributed (everyone contributes to survival)
- **Narration**: "Your crash landing has left you stranded in the untamed jungle. You'll need to establish shelter, find food and water, and navigate through treacherous terrain to reach the nearest outpost."

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**GM**: "The ancient Martian vault door won't budge. The security mechanism appears intact but hasn't been activated in centuries. This will be a Complex Task requiring 3 successes."

**Roland (Security Expert)**: "I'll examine the locking mechanism. I have Security (Lock Picking) at 75%."

*Roland rolls 43 - an ordinary success*

**GM**: "You identify the basic pattern of the ancient lock. That's 1 success toward the 3 you need."

**Roland**: "I'll carefully clear the dust from the internal components and try to align the tumblers."

*Roland rolls 25 - a special success (ends in 5)*

**GM**: "Your careful work pays off doubly well! The mechanism begins to respond as you align the ancient components. That's 2 more successes, bringing your total to 3. With a final adjustment, the massive door begins to slowly swing open, revealing a chamber untouched for millennia."

**GM**: "Meanwhile, Dr. Verne, you hear something moving in the darkness beyond the door..."

## EXTENDED EXAMPLE: EMERGENCY SURGERY

**GM**: "Lieutenant Parker has a severe chest wound with internal bleeding. Dr. Chen, this will be a Demanding Task requiring 5 successes, with checks every 5 minutes of surgery."

**Dr. Chen (CMO)**: "I'll lead the surgery. I have Medicine (Surgery) at 80%."

**Nurse Rodriguez**: "I'll assist. I have Medicine (Emergency) at 60%, so that's 40% with the assistant penalty."

**First Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 22 - an ordinary success*
*Nurse Rodriguez rolls 15 - a special success, but as an assistant counts as 1*
**GM**: "You begin the procedure well, locating the source of bleeding. That's 2 successes total."

**Second Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 80 - a critical failure (doubles on a failed roll)*
**GM**: "Just as you think you've contained the bleeding, a major vessel ruptures! You lose all accumulated successes and must start over with stabilizing the patient."

**Third Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 25 - a special success*
*Nurse Rodriguez rolls 92 - a failure*
**GM**: "You quickly regain control of the situation, stopping the bleeding with impressive skill. That's 2 successes."

**Fourth Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 54 - an ordinary success*
*Nurse Rodriguez rolls 31 - a success*
**GM**: "Working together, you continue repairing the damaged tissue. That's 2 more successes, bringing you to 4 total."

**Fifth Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 75 - a special failure (ends in 5 and fails)*
**GM**: "Just as you're about to close, you notice a small tear you missed. You'll need to repair it, setting you back slightly. You lose 1 success, dropping to 3 total."

**Sixth Check:**
*Dr. Chen rolls 44 - an ordinary success*
*Nurse Rodriguez rolls 38 - a success*
**GM**: "With careful work, you repair the tear and finally complete the procedure. With 5 total successes, Lieutenant Parker will make a full recovery."
