# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## CORE SKILL MECHANICS

### Skill Level Calculation

* **Completely Untrained** : Attribute × 2
* **Core Skill** : (Attribute × 2) + 5%
* **Specialization** : Core Skill % + Specialization Bonus

When a profession grants a specialization, it also implicitly grants the core skill:

* **Primary Specialization (+40%)** : Core skill at +20%
* **Secondary Specialization (+20%)** : Core skill at +10%
* **Tertiary Specialization (+10%)** : Core skill at +5%

> **Important** : Core skills cannot be improved directly. Only specializations can be advanced through experience. The core skill serves as a foundation that represents basic familiarity with the general field.

### Basic Training

Every character starts with Basic Training, representing general self-defense training they received in their youth:

* Basic Training is (REFLEX × 2) + 15%
* It covers unnarmed combat, pistols, rifles, and first aid
* It never improves directly, but critical successes while using Basic Training can lead to developing the full specialized skill

## SKILL ADVANCEMENT

During an adventure, mark a specialization for potential advancement whenever:

1. You roll a critical success with the specialization
2. You succeed at a particularly difficult or dramatic use of the specialization
3. You succeed with the specialization in a life-threatening or high-stakes situation

At the end of the adventure:

1. For each marked specialization, roll d100 against your current percentage
2. If you fail the roll (roll above your current percentage), you've found room for improvement
3. Increase the specialization by the value of the ones die on your failed roll (for higher skills only if it is <= the threshhold)

If you earn an advancement check using Basic Training or a Core Skill:

1. You may establish a new specialization at Basic Training Skill % + 5%.
2. You must specify which specialization you're developing

### Skill Plateaus

As specializations reach higher levels, advancement becomes more difficult:

* **Skilled (50-69%)** : Skills at this level only improve on a roll with a ones digit of 1-5
* **Expert (70-89%)** : Skills at this level only improve on a roll with a ones digit of 1-3
* **Master (90%+)** : Skills at this level only improve on a roll with a ones digit of 1

This approach ensures that characters develop specialized expertise rather than becoming broadly superhuman, fitting the pulp adventure aesthetic of Atomic Tomorrow.
