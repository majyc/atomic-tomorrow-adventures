This revision preserves all the professions and their equipment lists while updating the skill bonus notation to align with the skills system document. The notation "Core+15%" indicates adding 15% to the core skill value, rather than using a flat bonus, which better integrates with the unified skills system

## UNIFIED SKILLS SYSTEM

This document establishes the standardized skill mechanics for Atomic Tomorrow Adventures, explaining how skills are organized, calculated, and advanced during play.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Skill Organization

Skills in Atomic Tomorrow are organized into two layers:

- **Core Skills**: Broad categories representing general competence in a field
- **Specializations**: Specific applications that represent focused expertise

All characters have access to core skills based on their attributes, with specializations representing additional training in specific applications.

### Two Types of Skills

Skills come in two fundamental types:

1. **Attribute-Based Skills**: Skills directly tied to a specific attribute

   - Base value = (Attribute × 2) + 5%
   - Example: Athletics is based on BRAWN
2. **FLEX Skills**: Skills representing knowledge that relies more on training than raw talent

   - Base value = 25% (equivalent to having an attribute of 10)
   - Example: Academics represents scholarly knowledge independent of natural aptitude

### Professional Training

A character's profession provides additional training in specific skills:

- **Primary Professional Bonus**: a specialization bonus of base value + 15%
- **Secondary Professional Bonus**: a specialization bonus of base value + 10%
- **Tertiary Professional Bonus**: a specialization bonus of base value + 5%

These bonuses stack with the base skill values to create your final skill percentages.

## SKILL CALCULATION

### Attribute-Based Skills

- **Untrained**: Attribute × 2
- **Base Formula**: (Attribute × 2) + 5%
- **With Professional Bonus**: (Attribute × 2) + 5% + Professional Bonus

### FLEX Core Skills

- **Untrained**: 15%
- **Base Value**: 25%
- **With Professional Bonus**: 25% + Professional Bonus

### Specializations

- **Attribute-Based**: (Attribute × 2) + 5% + Professional Bonus + Specialization Bonus
- **FLEX-Based**: 25% + Professional Bonus + Specialization Bonus

### Examples

**Example 1: Navigation (Space)**

- Character with SAVVY 14
- Navigation as Secondary Professional skill
- Base Core Skill: (14 × 2) + 5% = 33%
- With Secondary Professional Bonus: 33% + 10% = 43%

**Example 2: Academics (History)**

- Skill with no special attribute influence (FLEX skill)
- Academics as Primary Professional skill
- Base Core Skill: 25%
- With Primary Professional Bonus: 25% + 15% = 40%

## USING SKILLS

### Core Skills vs Specializations

- **When to Use Core Skill**: When attempting a broad application or something not covered by your specializations
- **When to Use Specialization**: When attempting a task that directly aligns with your specialized training

### Default Attempts

Characters can attempt skills even without training:

- For attribute-based skills without training: Roll against (Attribute × 2)
- For FLEX skills without training: Roll against 15%

### Using Skills Under Pressure

- **Combat**: One major skill action per round
- **Timed**: Skill attempts require defined timeframe
- **Crisis**: Attribute-based skill attempts under immediate threat take -20% penalty; immediate threat doesn't mean merely in combat, it means somebody has fired at you in the past round, or you're defusing a bomb with the timer at less than 60 seconds left.
- **FLEX Skills Under Pressure**: No penalty in crisis situations, representing how training prevails under stress

### Solar Scouts Training

Every character starts with Solar Scouts Training, representing general self-defense training they received in their youth:

- Solar Scouts Training is (REFLEX × 2) + 15%
- It covers unnarmed combat, pistols, rifles, and first aid
- It never improves directly, but critical successes while using Solar Scouts Training can lead to developing the full specialized skill

### Supporting Specializations

When one specialization would logically support another, grant a +10% bonus:

- Using Navigation (Space) to support Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Using Medicine (Emergency) to support Medicine (Surgery)
- Using Science (Chemistry) to support Demolitions

## SKILL ADVANCEMENT

During an adventure, mark a specialization for potential advancement whenever:

1. You roll a critical success with the specialization
2. You succeed at a particularly difficult or dramatic use of the specialization
3. You succeed with the specialization in a life-threatening or high-stakes situation

At the end of the adventure:

1. For each marked specialization, roll d100 against your current percentage
2. If you fail the roll (roll above your current percentage), you've found room for improvement
3. Increase the specialization by the value of the ones die on your failed roll

If you earn an advancement check using Solar Scouts Training or a Core Skill:

1. You may establish a new specialization at the Core Skill % + 5%
2. You must specify which specialization you're developing

### Skill Plateaus

As specializations reach higher levels, advancement becomes more difficult:

- **Skilled (50-69%)**: Skills at this level only improve on a ones digit of 1-5
- **Expert (70-89%)**: Skills at this level only improve on a ones digit of 1-3
- **Master (90%+)**: Skills at this level only improve on a ones digit of 1
