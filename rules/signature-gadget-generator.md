## ATOMIC ADJECTIVE EFFECTS

1. **Atomo-** - Powered by miniature atomic pile that never needs recharging. On fumbles, emits harmless but alarming blue glow for lower of 2d10 rounds.
2. **Astro-** - Incorporates star-metal from beyond the asteroid belt. Functions perfectly in deep space and adds +15% to astronomy-related checks.
3. **Cosmo-** - Attuned to cosmic ray frequencies. Can detect alien technology within 20 meters and identifies its basic purpose automatically.
4. **Electro-** - Crackling with visible electrical energy. Deals 2 shock damage to anything that attacks you while you're holding it.
5. **Nucleo-** - Glows with eerie green light. Performance increased by 25%, but on any roll showing a 9 on either die releases harmless radiation that makes Geiger counters go wild.
6. **Chrono-** - Strange temporal properties allow you to see 3 seconds into the future when using it. After a particularly effective use (any critical success), you may declare you "already prepared for this" and pull out exactly the right attachment, but the device then requires 1 hour to reset.
7. **Magneto-** - Generates localized magnetic field. Can attract/repel metal objects weighing up to 10kg at 5 meters distance. Sticks to any metal surface when not in use.
8. **Quantum-** - Exists in multiple states simultaneously. After a failed roll using this device, you may declare "that didn't happen" and reroll, but the device becomes unusable for lower of 2d10 hours afterward.
9. **Gyro-** - Incorporates incredible stabilization technology. Grants perfect balance in zero-G and negates penalties from movement, turbulence, or unstable platforms.
10. **Hyper-** - Operates at incredible speeds. Actions that normally take two rounds complete in one, and you get +15% on initiative when using this device.

## TECHNO-COMPONENT EFFECTS

1. **-Tron** - Self-aware (but non-sentient) computation elements. Automatically suggests optimal settings and gives warning beeps before dangerous situations.
2. **-Ray** - Projects focused energy beam with 50-meter range. Can be adjusted to heat, freeze, or illuminate targets without causing damage.
3. **-Matic** - Numerous extending arms and auto-deploying components. Can be set up or reconfigured as a free action and operates independently once programmed.
4. **-Wave** - Emits specialized wavelengths that pass through solid matter. Can scan or affect targets through up to 1 meter of standard materials (not lead or other exotic substances).
5. **-Flux** - Constantly shifts and adapts to circumstances. Gains +5% effectiveness for each consecutive round used on the same task (max +25%).
6. **-Static** - Generates localized field that disrupts energy patterns. Can temporarily disable electronic devices within 5 meters with successful SAVVY roll.
7. **-Field** - Projects dome-shaped energy barrier. Can create 3-meter radius protective field that blocks normal projectiles for lower of 2d10 rounds, but requires 24 hours to recharge afterward.
8. **-Pulse** - Emits regular energy pulses. Can be tuned to resonate with and strengthen (or weaken) specific materials or energy forms.
9. **-Scope** - Incredible sensory enhancement capabilities. Zoom vision up to 5x, sees in infrared/ultraviolet, and detects motion within 20 meters.
10. **-Beam** - Focused energy projection system. Double range or area of effect compared to standard models, with distinctive color that's your character's trademark.

## SERIES DESIGNATION EFFECTS

1. **Mark Ω** - The ultimate evolution of this technology. When using it for its primary function, any roll ending in 0 counts as a critical success.
2. **Deluxe** - Gleaming chrome with atomic-age styling. Impresses onlookers automatically and grants +15% to relevant social checks.
3. **Z-Series** - Experimental prototype not available to the public. Has one completely unexpected secondary function of your choice that activates on any roll of 01-05.
4. **Plus** - Enhanced model with additional features. Contains complete functionality of another device that can be accessed with a quick adjustment.
5. **Supreme** - Peak quality construction. Functions perfectly in three extreme environments: vacuum, underwater, extreme heat, extreme cold, high radiation, etc.
6. **X-1000** - Thousand-times prototype with enhanced capabilities. You can declare it has exactly the specialized attachment you need for the current situation, but this completely drains its power and requires a full 24 hours to recharge.
7. **Wonder** - Incredibly user-friendly with intuitive controls. Anyone can use it without training, and you never fumble when using its basic functions.
8. **Paragon** - The standard by which all others are judged. When using this device, difficulty ratings for related tasks are reduced by one level.
9. **Galaxy** - Advanced alien technology incorporated into Earth science. Performs its function through means that seem magical even to scientists, and works when similar devices fail.
10. **Ultra** - Pushed far beyond normal operational parameters. Range, duration, and effectiveness all increased by 50%, but requires 2 hours of careful maintenance after each use or it begins to malfunction (roll 1d10 on any use without maintenance: on a 1-3, it fails spectacularly).
