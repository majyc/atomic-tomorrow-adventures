I'd be happy to develop a flight system for Venus in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures! The retro-atomic age pulp aesthetic fits perfectly with different aircraft types exploring a steamy jungle Venus with varied atmospheric conditions.

# VENUS ATMOSPHERIC FLIGHT SYSTEM

## ATMOSPHERIC LAYERS & FLIGHT CONDITIONS

Venus in Atomic Tomorrow has three distinctive atmospheric zones, each with unique challenges:

* **Hazards** : Unpredictable wind shears, radiation exposure

### MID ATMOSPHERE (Twilight Zone)

* **Pressure** : 2-3x Earth normal
* **Visibility** : Limited, constant mist and cloud formations
* **Weather** : Massive storm systems, acid rain, fog banks
* **Hazards** : Pressure fluctuations, corrosive precipitation

### LOWER ATMOSPHERE (Jungle Canopy)

* **Pressure** : 5-8x Earth normal

* Experience enhanced reaction time under pressure (+10% to all Piloting checks)
* Risk mild hallucinations on rolls ending in 3 (GM introduces minor visual distortion)
* Develop unique sensitivity to atmospheric patterns (can detect weather changes before instruments)

### AIRCRAFT LIMITATIONS BY ZONE

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION

This flight system integrates with core Atomic Tomorrow mechanics:

1. Uses the d100 system with special interpretations for doubles and divisible-by-5 results
2. Creates meaningful choices about aircraft types for different missions
3. Establishes Venus-specific challenges that highlight the setting's unique features
4. Provides opportunities for character specialization and equipment customization
5. Creates multiple adventure hooks related to aerial exploration

Would you like me to expand on any specific aspect of this flight system? Perhaps more detail on specific aircraft models, flight mechanics for a particular aircraft type, or adventure hooks related to aerial exploration of Venus?
