| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Standard Cells      | Low          | Medium         | Frequent     | Universal              | None        |
| Solar Systems       | Medium       | None           | Rare         | Anywhere with sunlight | None        |
| Chemical Generators | Medium       | High           | Occasional   | Fuel-dependent         | Minimal     |
| Atomic Systems      | Very High    | None           | Almost Never | Limited                | Strict      |
