## Intellectual

* **Brilliant** (extra knowledge skills, solve puzzles faster)
* **Analytical** (bonus when examining clues or technology)

## Skill-Focused

* **Ace** (mastery in one specific area, spectacular critical successes)
* **Veteran** (experience-based bonuses, seen it all before)

* An **Eccentric Engineer** could create unusual devices with unexpected benefits, sometimes failing spectacularly but other times achieving the impossible.
* A **Doomed Explorer** might have enhanced abilities when pushing into the unknown, but always at terrible personal cost.
