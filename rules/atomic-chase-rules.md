# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: VEHICLE CHASE SYSTEM

## CORE MECHANICS: TWO-PHASE PURSUIT

### DISTANCE TRACKING

- **Distance 1-2**: Contact range (ramming, boarding possible)
- **Distance 3-4**: Close range (melee attacks possible with reach weapons)
- **Distance 5-7**: Medium range (most ranged weapons effective)
- **Distance 8-9**: Extended range (visual contact maintained)
- **Distance 10+**: Escape achieved (pursuer loses sight of the lead vehicle)

#### ADJUSTING CHASE PARAMETERS

The Game Master may adjust these parameters for different scenarios:

**Extended Chases** (Start: 7, Escape: 12):

- Use for major story pursuits, complex urban environments, or when multiple hazards should be encountered
- Results in longer chases (6-8 rounds) with more opportunities for dramatic twists
- Better showcases vehicles with superior speed and maneuverability

**Quick Pursuits** (Start: 4, Escape: 8):

- Use for minor encounters, simple terrain, or when time is limited
- Creates brief, intense chases (2-3 rounds) that resolve quickly
- Favors the pursuer slightly, making escape more challenging

**Dramatic Standoffs** (Start: 3, Escape: 10):

- Use when the pursuer has a significant advantage initially
- Creates tension as the lead vehicle must gain substantial ground to escape
- Works well for "starting from a stop" scenarios like a sudden ambush

Whatever parameters you choose, remember that distance is abstract—it represents relative positioning rather than exact measurements. The drama of the chase matters more than precise distances!

Each round, track the current distance between vehicles using a die or marker. When distance reaches or exceeds the escape threshold, the lead vehicle successfully escapes. When distance drops to the contact threshold or below, the pursuer has caught up to the lead vehicle.## PHASE 1: DRIVING CONTEST

Each round begins with an opposed Vehicle Operation roll between drivers:

### OPPOSED ROLL OUTCOMES

- **Lead vehicle wins by Critical vs. Failure**: +3 distance (pulls ahead)
- **Lead vehicle wins by Special vs. Regular/Failure**: +2 distance
- **Lead vehicle wins by Regular vs. Failure**: +1 distance
- **Pursuer wins by Critical vs. Failure**: -3 distance (closes gap)
- **Pursuer wins by Special vs. Regular/Failure**: -2 distance
- **Pursuer wins by Regular vs. Failure**: -1 distance
- **Same quality of success**: Higher roll wins, +/-1 distance

### VEHICLE FACTORS

- Add Speed Rating (SR) and Maneuverability (MR) modifiers to Vehicle Operation rolls
- Terrain Speed Caps limit effective SR advantage in certain environments

## PHASE 2: HAZARD RESPONSE

After determining distance change in Phase 1, the referee randomly generates a hazard:

### HAZARD GENERATION

- Referee rolls d10 to determine hazard type
- Lead driver selects Risk Level (1-3)
- Lead driver makes Vehicle Operation roll with modifiers for Risk Level and MR
- **Success**: No additional effect (already accounted for in Phase 1)
- **Failure**: Lead vehicle rolls on Mishap Table with modifier based on Risk Level

### PURSUER OPTIONS

**FOLLOW THROUGH**

- Attempt the same hazard at same Risk Level
- **Success**: No additional distance change
- **Failure**: Distance increases by 3 (+1 for Special Failure, +2 for Critical Failure)
- **Critical Failure**: Distance increases by 5 and roll on Mishap Table with +20

**PLAY IT SAFE**

- Choose not to navigate the hazard
- Distance automatically increases by 4
- No roll on Mishap Table

**ALTERNATE ROUTE** (Only available for certain hazards)

- Attempt to find a different path
- Roll Navigation at -40%
- **Success**: Distance increases by 2
- **Special Success**: Distance increases by 1
- **Critical Success**: No distance change
- **Failure**: Distance increases by 5
- **Special Failure**: Distance increases by 7
- **Critical Failure**: Chase ends (completely lost visual contact)

## SPECIAL ACTIONS

These can be used instead of the normal Phase 2 options:

### SHORTCUT GAMBIT (PURSUER ONLY)

- Roll Navigation at -40%
- **Critical Success**: Distance decreases by 5
- **Special Success**: Distance decreases by 3
- **Regular Success**: Distance decreases by 2

- **Special Success**: Lead gains +3 distance, pursuer loses -3 distance
- **Critical Success**: Lead gains +4 distance, pursuer loses -4 distance
- **Failure**: No distance change and 1 damage to Propulsion
- **Critical Failure**: 2 damage to Propulsion and roll on Mishap Table

### OFFENSIVE MANEUVER

- Attempt to interfere with the other vehicle's progress
- Must be at distance 1-3

- **Catastrophe**: The unstable formula ignites in a spectacular cascade of blue-white flames as the atomic accelerator redlines. Vehicle shoots forward at maximum speed, requiring Vehicle Operation rolls at -40% each round until a success is achieved.

### GYROSCOPIC STABILIZATION

- **Normal Function**: +20% to any one hazard roll per chase
- **Description**: Advanced spinning gyros that maintain vehicle stability in extreme maneuvers
- **Catastrophe**: The precision gyros break free from their housings and tear through the vehicle's inner workings like metal pinballs. Vehicle spins wildly out of control, and all occupants must make REFLEX checks or be thrown about the cabin.

### REINFORCED FRAME

- **Normal Function**: Ignore the first Structure damage in any chase
- **Description**: Advanced metallurgy and additional structural bracing with distinctive external braces
- **Catastrophe**: The reinforced components suddenly buckle under opposing stresses, twisting the vehicle's frame with a terrible metallic shriek. The vehicle's Structure system automatically takes the damage from this failure, and handling suffers -20% until repairs are completed.

### ATOMIC COOLING SYSTEM

- **Normal Function**: SR cannot be reduced by system damage
- **Description**: Specialized cooling apparatus with glowing blue conduits and distinctive fins
- **Catastrophe**: Pressurized cooling fluid erupts from ruptured pipes, instantly flash-freezing exposed components. Vehicle stalls completely and requires a successful Engineering (Propulsion) check to restart.

### ADVANCED TRACTION SYSTEM

- **Normal Function**: +20% to hazards involving surface changes or weather conditions
- **Description**: Automatically adjusting wheels/treads that conform to terrain conditions
- **Catastrophe**: The adaptive materials in the tires/treads suddenly shred themselves against the surface in a dramatic burst of rubber and sparks. Vehicle immediately loses 50% of its current speed and handling suffers -20% until repairs are completed.

### ATOMIC RADAR

- **Normal Function**: Once per chase, reveals outcome of Alternate Route before committing
- **Description**: Experimental scanning system with distinctive rotating dome antenna
- **Catastrophe**: The scanning system emits a high-pitched whine before the dome explodes in a shower of sparks and fragments. Driver suffers complete instrument failure, imposing -40% to all driving-related checks until a SAVVY check is passed.

### COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY SYSTEM

- **Normal Function**: When rolling on the Mishap Table, reduce the roll by 20 (minimum 01)
- **Description**: Advanced protective systems including impact-sensing airbags, automatic bracing mechanisms, and emergency stabilizers
- **Catastrophe**: All safety measures deploy simultaneously, filling the cabin with protective foam and restraints that obstruct controls and visibility. Driver must make a BRAWN check to reach the controls and a SAVVY check to operate them effectively.

### ULTRA-PERFORMANCE EXHAUST COMPENSATOR

- **Normal Function**: Provides +1 SR when the vehicle is damaged; system needs 10 minutes to recharge after use
- **Description**: Specialized thrust enhancers that glow with vibrant blue light when activated, producing a distinctive whooshing sound
- **Catastrophe**: The atomic exhaust system backfires catastrophically, leaving a trail of burning atomic particles and partially melted components. Vehicle loses 1 Speed Rating permanently until a complete exhaust system replacement is installed.

### AUTOMATED NAVIGATION ASSIST

- **Normal Function**: +20% to all Alternate Route attempts; provides real-time hazard warnings on upcoming terrain
- **Description**: Dashboard-mounted guidance system with rotating radar dish and illuminated map display showing potential shortcuts
- **Catastrophe**: The navigation system confidently announces "RECALCULATING ROUTE" before steering directly toward the nearest hazard. Vehicle automatically attempts to drive toward the nearest obstacle, requiring a Vehicle Operation check at -20% to override.

### MODULAR ARMOR PLATING

- **Normal Function**: Each piece of armor absorbs one point of system damage before becoming useless; vehicle starts with 2 armor plates that must be replaced after use, Reduces SR and MR by one each.
- **Description**: Honeycombed shock-absorbing panels with distinctive riveted seams that can be quickly replaced after damage
- **Catastrophe**: The armor plates detach from their mounting points and cascade off the vehicle like metallic autumn leaves. Vehicle loses all armor benefits and all new damage taken is increased by 1 until repairs are completed.

## ADJUSTING THE CHASE LENGTH

The default chase configuration uses a starting distance of 5, with escape occurring at distance 10. This creates tense, action-packed chases that typically resolve in 4-5 rounds—ideal for maintaining excitement without dominating your gaming session.

# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: VEHICLE CHASE SYSTEM

## EXAMPLE CHASE SEQUENCE

**Referee**: "The sleek black Lunox-8 Diplomat with suspicious embassy markings (SR 3, MR 3) tears away from the Tranquility Embassy dome as your Comet-Streak Turbo (SR 4, MR 4) follows in hot pursuit. You're at distance 5 as they enter the busy pressure-tunnels of New Armstrong. The chase begins!"

*The terrain is dense lunar urban with a speed cap of SR 2, so both vehicles effectively have SR 2 for the driving contest*

**Referee**: "You're both in pressurized transit tunnels, which caps effective SR at 2 due to pedestrian traffic and lunar safety regulations. Let's start with Phase 1 - the driving contest."

*Both players roll Vehicle Operation:
Lead vehicle: 60% + 20% (SR 2) + 20% (MR 3) = 100%, rolls 43 - success
Pursuit vehicle: 80% + 20% (SR 2) + 40% (MR 4) = 140%, rolls 25 - special success*

**Referee**: "Your superior handling helps you close the gap! The Comet-Streak's gyroscopic stabilization system adjusts perfectly to the 1/6 gravity as you navigate the curved tunnel. The pursuer wins with a special success vs. a regular success, gaining -2 distance. You're now at distance 3, within close range!"

**Referee**: "Now for Phase 2. I'll roll to determine what hazard appears."

*Rolls d10, gets 2*

"The Lunox-8 is approaching a busy transit hub where automated cargo pods cross paths with commuter trams! They'll need to weave between magnetic rail carriages with precision. They choose Risk Level 2 for this hazard."

*Lead vehicle rolls Vehicle Operation: 60% + 20% (MR 3) - 20% (RL 2) = 60%, rolls 72 - failure*

"The Diplomat clips a hydroponic supply pod as it passes! The collision sends leafy greens and nutrient solution spraying across the polished tunnel floor. They'll need to roll on the Mishap Table with +20 for Risk Level 2."

*Rolls 43 + 20 = 63 on Mishap Table*

"The impact disrupts their hover stability momentarily. They experience a Control Issue and will need to make a successful Vehicle Operation roll next round or lose an additional distance."

**Referee**: "This hazard allows for an Alternate Route option. Will you follow through the same hazard, play it safe, or find an alternate route?"

**Player**: "I'll follow through! My Vehicle Operation is solid with my MR bonus, and my Comet-Streak's micro-thrusters are calibrated perfectly for lunar conditions."

*Rolls Vehicle Operation: 80% + 40% (MR 4) - 20% (RL 2) = 100%, rolls 22 - critical success with matching doubles!*

**Referee**: "Your Comet-Streak zips through the transit hub with breathtaking precision! Your atomic-powered reaction wheels compensate instantaneously for the low gravity as you navigate between trams and hover-carts. Your critical success lets you maintain the current distance of 3."

**Referee**: "Phase 1 of the next round. Both vehicles make their driving contest rolls."

*Lead vehicle must make an additional Vehicle Operation roll to resolve the Control Issue from last round:
Lead vehicle control check: 60% + 20% (MR 3) = 80%, rolls 92 - failure
This means they lose 1 additional distance automatically*

*Driving contest rolls:
Lead vehicle: 60% + 20% (SR 2) + 20% (MR 3) = 100%, rolls 83 - failure
Pursuit vehicle: 80% + 20% (SR 2) + 40% (MR 4) = 140%, rolls 37 - success*

**Referee**: "The Diplomat is still struggling with the effects of the collision! Their vacuum-rated suspension tries to compensate, but lunar dust has gotten into the repulsion intakes. They fail their control check, losing 1 distance automatically. Then, in the driving contest, your superior handling gives you another advantage. You close to distance 1! You're right on their tail, close enough to attempt an Offensive Maneuver!"

**Player**: "Perfect! I'll attempt an Offensive Maneuver to force them toward the emergency airlock chambers. Maybe they'll think twice about trying to escape if they're facing a potential hull breach!"

**Referee**: "Roll Vehicle Operation against their Vehicle Operation."

*Player rolls 43 on Vehicle Operation (80% + 40% MR = 120%) - success
Opponent rolls 75 on Vehicle Operation (60% + 20% MR = 80%) - failure*

**Referee**: "Your aggressive maneuver works! As the Diplomat tries to navigate the smooth lunar-concrete curve, you expertly cut them off, forcing them to swerve sharply toward the emergency airlocks. They must make a Vehicle Operation roll or take damage."

*Opponent rolls 82 - failure*

**Referee**: "They lose control completely! The Diplomat's ground-effect cushions fail as they clip a pressure-seal door frame, sending the vehicle skidding across the frictionless floor in a shower of sparks. The vehicle spins almost gracefully in the low gravity before crashing into a moon-rock decorative fountain. Their radiator fins are crumpled, and coolant vapor sublimates instantly in the climate-controlled air. You see the three occupants—wearing the distinctive Stalinka tunics of Novyy Stalingrad security forces—scrambling out of the vehicle. The leader clutches a metallic briefcase with radiation warning symbols, looking frantically for an escape route through the gathering crowd of wide-eyed lunar citizens in their silvery pressure-ready garments."

*The chase has now transitioned to a potential foot pursuit or confrontation as the player decides their next action...*
