# Medical System Failure Mechanisms: Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis explores different ways medical treatment can permanently fail in the Atomic Tomorrow Adventures system. The original rules lacked explicit failure conditions, creating a critical gap in gameplay flow and strategic decision-making. Six different failure mechanisms were tested to determine optimal balance between realism, game flow, and strategic depth.

## The Problem

The original medical card system rules specify treatment mechanics but not permanent failure conditions. This creates several issues:

1. **Infinite Treatment Loops**: Low-skill medics could theoretically roll forever on high-value cards
2. **Unclear Resource Limits**: No guidance on when to stop treatment attempts
3. **Missing Narrative Stakes**: No mechanism for "making things worse" through poor treatment
4. **Gameplay Pacing**: Uncertainty about when medical scenes should end

## Tested Failure Mechanisms

### 1. Original (20/20)
**Limits**: 20 attempts per card, 20 MSU total
- **Success Rate**: 69.4%
- **Avg Attempts**: 19.1
- **Primary Failures**: Resource depletion (20.0%), attempt limits (10.6%)

### 2. Strict Attempts
**Limits**: 15 attempts per card only
- **Success Rate**: 84.3% ⭐ **HIGHEST**
- **Avg Attempts**: 18.2
- **Primary Failures**: Attempt limits (15.7%)

### 3. Strict Resources  
**Limits**: 15 MSU total only
- **Success Rate**: 69.9%
- **Avg Attempts**: 23.5 (slowest)
- **Primary Failures**: Resource depletion (30.1%)

### 4. Treatment Escalation
**Limits**: 20/20 + escalation if same-suit card ≥3 values higher appears
- **Success Rate**: 32.5%
- **Avg Attempts**: 8.6 ⭐ **FASTEST**
- **Primary Failures**: Treatment escalation (55.2%)

### 5. Natural Healing Cutoff
**Limits**: 20/20 + automatic stop after clearing 3 cards
- **Success Rate**: 41.4%
- **Avg Attempts**: 16.1
- **Primary Failures**: Natural healing cutoff (38.5%)

### 6. Combined Strict
**Limits**: 10 attempts, 15 MSU, escalation ≥2, stop after 2 cards
- **Success Rate**: 9.7% (too harsh)
- **Avg Attempts**: 4.5
- **Primary Failures**: Treatment escalation (59.5%)

## Key Findings

### Gameplay Flow Impact
- **Treatment Escalation** creates fastest resolution (8.6 attempts avg)
- **Strict Attempts** provides best balance of success and speed
- **Resource-only limits** create longest, most frustrating experiences

### Strategic Differentiation
Different mechanisms fundamentally change optimal strategies:

**Severe Burns Example (Novice Medic, 4 wounds):**

| Mechanism | Conservative | Foresight | Resource Heavy |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Original | 32.0% | 42.5% | 27.0% |
| Strict Attempts | 100.0% | 14.0% | 100.0% |
| Strict Resources | 11.0% | 100.0% | 4.0% |
| Treatment Escalation | 9.5% | 16.0% | 7.5% |

### Narrative Meaningfulness

**Treatment Escalation** creates the most narratively compelling failures:
- 55.2% of failures due to "making it worse"
- Forces difficult decisions about continuing treatment
- Simulates realistic medical complications

**Natural Healing Cutoff** provides logical stopping points:
- 38.5% of treatments end at "let the body take over"
- Prevents endless intervention attempts
- Creates triage pressure

## Detailed Analysis by Injury Severity

### Light Injuries (2 wounds)
- **All mechanisms**: High success rates (80-95%)
- **Failure differences**: Minimal impact on easy cases
- **Recommendation**: Any mechanism works for basic treatment

### Moderate Injuries (3 wounds)  
- **Escalation/Combined**: Create meaningful failure risk (40-60% success)
- **Attempt limits**: Maintain high success with defined endpoints
- **Resource limits**: Create resource pressure without excessive failure

### Severe Injuries (4+ wounds)
- **Critical differentiation point** between mechanisms
- **Escalation**: Creates genuine medical emergencies (10-20% success)
- **Attempt limits**: Allow skilled medics to succeed through persistence
- **Resource limits**: Favor efficient strategies over brute force

## Recommended Implementation

### Primary Recommendation: **Hybrid Escalation + Attempt Limits**

**Proposed Mechanism:**
- **15 attempts per card maximum**
- **20 MSU total limit**  
- **Treatment escalation**: If upcoming same-suit card is ≥3 values higher, treatment fails
- **Natural healing**: Optional stop after clearing 2-3 cards for non-critical patients

### Rationale:
1. **Gameplay Flow**: 15-attempt limit prevents excessive rolling
2. **Resource Pressure**: 20 MSU creates meaningful scarcity
3. **Narrative Stakes**: Escalation provides "making it worse" scenarios
4. **Strategic Depth**: Different optimal approaches for different situations

### Implementation Details:

## TREATMENT FAILURE CONDITIONS

Treatment permanently fails when ANY of the following occurs:

### Attempt Exhaustion
- After 15 failed Medicine rolls on a single card
- **Narrative**: "You've tried everything you know, but the injury is beyond your current skill"
- **Game Effect**: Card remains, wound stays as wound (not converted to strain)

### Resource Depletion  
- When MSU supplies are exhausted (20 total limit per treatment sequence)
- **Narrative**: "You've used all available medical supplies"
- **Game Effect**: Must choose between continuing without backup or stopping treatment

### Treatment Escalation
- When the next same-suit card in sequence is ≥3 values higher than current card
- Check occurs before starting treatment on each new card
- **Narrative**: "Your intervention is making the condition worse"
- **Game Effect**: Immediate treatment failure, original wound severity maintained

### Natural Healing Point (Optional)
- After successfully clearing 2-3 cards in non-critical patients
- GM discretion based on injury severity and time pressure
- **Narrative**: "Further intervention risks complications; let the body heal naturally"
- **Game Effect**: Remaining wounds convert to strain at 1 per day natural healing rate
```

## Strategic Implications

### Strategy Viability Changes:

**Conservative Strategy:**
- Remains strong for resource-backed reliability
- Vulnerable to attempt limits on high-value cards
- Best for skilled medics with MSU access

**Foresight Strategy:**  
- Gains importance for escalation avoidance
- Can preview upcoming dangerous combinations
- Essential for navigating complex injury sequences

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Becomes critical for avoiding escalation scenarios
- Extra successes used to discard dangerous upcoming cards
- High-value for experienced medics

**Resource Heavy Strategy:**
- Limited by 20 MSU cap
- Still viable for critical early-game stabilization
- Must be used judiciously rather than universally

## Conclusion

The **Hybrid Escalation + Attempt Limits** mechanism provides:

✅ **Clear failure conditions** ending infinite loops
✅ **Meaningful strategic choices** across skill levels  
✅ **Narrative coherence** with realistic medical outcomes
✅ **Balanced difficulty scaling** from light to critical injuries
✅ **Resource scarcity** without excessive frustration
✅ **"Making it worse" scenarios** for dramatic tension

This approach maintains the original system's strategic depth while adding essential gameplay structure and narrative stakes that were missing from the initial design.
