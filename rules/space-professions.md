# Streamlined Pulp Space Professions



You're right about keeping things punchy and manageable! Here's a more focused list with shorter, more evocative profession names that would work well in a "Column A + Column B" character creation system:



## Column B: Professions



### Explorers & Scientists

- **Scout** (first into unknown territory)

- **Hunter** (pursues dangerous alien fauna)

- **Archaeologist** (investigates ancient ruins)

- **Scientist** (studies alien phenomena)

- **Medic** (treats exotic ailments and injuries)



### Military & Security

- **Marine** (military specialist in alien environments)

- **Gunner** (weapons expert)

- **Patroller** (enforces law between worlds)

- **Bodyguard** (protects important personnel)

- **Veteran** (survivor of alien conflicts)



### Pilots & Engineers

- **Rocket Jockey** (spacecraft pilot)

- **Engineer** (builds and fixes advanced tech)

- **Miner** (extracts resources from asteroids and planets)

- **Navigator** (plots courses through dangerous space)

- **Mechanic** (keeps machines running in hostile environments)



### Fringe & Commerce

- **Smuggler** (moves contraband between planets)

- **Merchant** (trades exotic goods)

- **Gambler** (risks everything for high stakes)

- **Fixer** (solves problems, no questions asked)

- **Drifter** (wanders between colonies)



### Information & Communication

- **Newshound** (reports on interplanetary events)

- **Diplomat** (negotiates between human and alien factions)

- **Spy** (gathers intelligence in hostile territory)

- **Hacker** (cracks advanced computer systems)

- **Archivist** (preserves knowledge of Earth and beyond)



## Character Creation Approach



For player-friendly character creation, you could present it like this:



1. **Step 1:** Choose an epithet from Column A (Two-Fisted, Crack, Intrepid, etc.)

2. **Step 2:** Choose a profession from Column B (Scout, Rocket Jockey, Smuggler, etc.)

3. **Step 3:** Combine them to create your character concept (e.g., "Grizzled Miner" or "Daredevil Rocket Jockey")



This keeps the process simple while still offering plenty of combinations (with 25+ epithets and 25 professions, you'd have 625+ possible character concepts). You could organize the options visually in a two-column chart, perhaps with simple icons next to each option to help players quickly understand what each represents.



Does this more streamlined approach work better for what you're envisioning?
