## ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## MEDICAL DILEMMAS SYSTEM

> "Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker! I've got three treatment options, and none of them are pretty!"

### CORE MEDICAL PHILOSOPHY

The medical system in Atomic Tomorrow creates meaningful choices through treatment tradeoffs that capture the essence of retro-futuristic medicine. When treating patients, doctors must balance immediate effectiveness against side effects and long-term complications, all while considering the current circumstances and available facilities.

## EMERGENCY STIMULANTS

| Treatment | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Best For |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Kermitomine** | Removes ALL wound penalties | Patient makes GRIT check when expires or falls unconscious and risks additional wound; muscle spasms occur on special failures (ending in 0 or 5) during use | Lasts until NERVE check succeeds, checked once per turn | Combat situations requiring immediate action |
| **Atlazine** | Functions despite wounds at -20% to all actions | Masks worsening conditions, symptoms that might warn of deterioration | Lasts until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per hour | Long missions where sudden crash would be dangerous |
| **Stim-Shot** | Removes ALL wound penalties | -40% penalty for all actions after effect ends, until GRIT check succeeds (checked hourly) | Until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per 4 hours | Operations with recovery time available after |
| **Psychotropic Analgesic** | Redirect wound penalties to chosen attributes | Double penalties to selected attributes; hallucinations occur on special or critical failures when using skills while under effect | Until NERVE check succeeds, checked once per 3 hours | When specific abilities must function at full capacity |

## TRAUMA TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Complications |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Bone-Knit Gel** | Treats fractures; eliminates penalties from bone injuries | Hypersensitive impact site; pain flare-ups during stress on special failures (-20% to all actions for 1 round) | Permanent for current injury | Micro-fractures that ache when atmospheric pressure changes occur on critical failures during recovery |
| **Vascular Sealant** | Stops bleeding; prevents circulatory complications | Area numbed; -20% to fine manipulation involving affected area | Permanent for current wound | Scar tissue development occurs on special failures during recovery checks |
| **Synthetic Tissue** | Reduces wound by 2 immediately | Site becomes hypersensitive to impact (-1 additional wound if struck in same area) | Until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per day | Tissue rejection occurs on critical failures during recovery (unless matched to patient DNA) |
| **Trauma Pak** | Comprehensive treatment reducing wound penalties by half | Requires 1 hour of rest after application | 24 hours | Dependency develops on special failures when using repeatedly within 48 hours |

## ENERGY DAMAGE TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Complications |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Coolant Spray** | Prevents burn progression | Area stiffens; -20% to actions requiring full flexibility | Until BRAWN check succeeds, checked once per hour | Cold damage to peripheral nerves occurs on critical failures during recovery |
| **Bioelectric Stabilizer** | Restores normal nerve function after energy weapon damage | Occasional muscle twitches; precise tasks fail on special failures | Until NERVE check succeeds, checked once per 4 hours | Energy sensitivity (+1 wound from future energy weapons) develops on critical failures during recovery |
| **Phase Realigner** | Counteracts energy weapon cellular disruption | Causes disorientation (-20% to all SAVVY checks) | Until SAVVY check succeeds, checked once per 2 hours | Temporary phase displacement (teleporting 1-2 feet when startled) occurs on special failures for 1d10 days after treatment |
| **Z-Ray Treatment** | Comprehensive energy damage repair | Patient emits faint radiation until GRIT check succeeds (checked daily) | 12 hours | Minor mutation (glowing eyes, unusual skin patterns, etc.) develops on special or critical failures during treatment |

## TOXIC/ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Complications |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Universal Antitoxin** | Neutralizes most common poisons and toxins | Suppressed immune system; 20% chance of contracting minor illness | Until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per day | 15% chance of developing sensitivity to common medications |
| **Radiation Purge** | Removes radioactive particles | Extreme fatigue (-40% to all BRAWN checks) | Until BRAWN check succeeds, checked once per 4 hours | 10% chance of temporary hair loss |
| **Atmospheric Adaptor** | Helps body adjust to alien environments | 20% of nutritional intake diverted to adaptation process | Until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per day | 20% chance of developing dependency on the alien atmosphere |
| **Cellular Restructuring** | Repairs genetic damage from extreme exposure | Patient unconscious | Until a series of 3 GRIT checks succeed, checked once per 8 hours | 30% chance of minor cellular mutation with unknown effects |

## SPECIALIZED TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Complications |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Cryofreeze** | Halts all deterioration for transport | Complete stasis; patient inactive | Until deliberate revival | 10% chance of incomplete thawing causing lingering cold sensitivity |
| **Nanite Injection** | Intelligent repair of critical injuries | 40% chance of fever and immune response | Until NERVE check succeeds, checked once per day | 25% chance of nanites establishing permanent presence in bloodstream |
| **Martian Red Clay Pack** | Draws out toxins and accelerates healing | Stains skin red for days | Until GRIT check succeeds, checked once per day | 15% chance of developing Martian mineral dependency |
| **Memory Block** | Prevents psychological trauma from injury | Creates 1-hour gap in memory | Permanent | 20% chance of blocking adjacent important memories |

## TREATMENT COMBINATIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS

Certain treatments interact with each other, creating synergies or dangerous complications.

### SYNERGISTIC PAIRS
These treatments work exceptionally well together:

| Treatment Combination | Enhanced Effect | Reduced Side Effect |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Coolant Spray + Vascular Sealant** | +1 damage reduction | Eliminates hypersensitivity side effect |
| **Stim-Shot + Atmospheric Adaptor** | No nutritional diversion | Recovery penalty reduced to -20% |
| **Bone-Knit Gel + Synthetic Tissue** | Removes bone injury penalties entirely | Reduces vulnerability to future impacts |

### DANGEROUS COMBINATIONS
These treatments create harmful interactions when used together:

| Treatment Combination | Contraindication Effect |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Kermitomine + Any Stimulant** | Immediate GRIT check or heart failure (1 wound) |
| **Z-Ray Treatment + Radiation Purge** | Radiation Purge effectiveness reduced by half; treatment duration doubled |
| **Nanite Injection + Bioelectric Stabilizer** | Nanites malfunction; roll on Mutation Table |
| **Multiple Stim-Shots** | Each additional shot requires GRIT check at cumulative -20% or immediate collapse |

## TREATMENT BY ENVIRONMENT

The setting significantly impacts treatment effectiveness and risk:

### FIELD TREATMENT (COMBAT OR WILDERNESS)
* Side effects like drowsiness or disorientation could be deadly
* Treatments requiring rest are impractical
* Kermitomine and Stim-Shots are preferred despite risks
* Each treatment attempt at -20% due to conditions

### SHIP'S MEDICAL BAY
* Limited resources might restrict options
* Side effects can be monitored and mitigated
* Environmental controls reduce treatment penalties
* Standard medical rolls with no modifier

### HOSPITAL OR MEDICAL FACILITY
* Allows for monitoring that mitigates most side effects
* Advanced equipment reduces complication chance by half
* Can effectively manage multiple treatments
* All medical rolls at +20% due to facilities

## TREATMENT DECISION TREE

When a character is injured, the medical officer should follow this decision path:

### IMMEDIATE TRIAGE
1. **Is patient incapacitated (4+ wounds)?**
   - YES → Kermitomine, Synthetic Tissue, or Trauma Pak
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Is immediate full function required?**
   - YES → Kermitomine (short-term) or Stim-Shot (medium-term)
   - NO → Continue to step 3

3. **What is injury type?**
   - BLUNT/PENETRATING → Appropriate trauma treatment
   - ENERGY → Appropriate energy treatment
   - TOXIC/ENVIRONMENTAL → Appropriate toxin treatment
   - MIXED → Atlazine (safest general option)

4. **How long until proper medical facilities?**
   - <6 HOURS → Stim-Shot (if full function needed)
   - 6-24 HOURS → Atlazine
   - >24 HOURS → Specific treatment + plan for complication management

## MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS SYSTEM

When complications occur, they create ongoing challenges rather than just simple penalties:

### COMPLICATION RESOLUTION
Complications occur based on special or critical failures during treatment or recovery:

* Special Failures (roll ending in 0 or 5): Standard complication occurs
* Critical Failures (doubles): Severe complication occurs
* Critical Failure + Special Failure (doubles ending in 0 or 5): Critical complication occurs

### COMPLICATION SEVERITY

| Standard Complication | Severe Complication | Critical Complication |
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Mild symptoms requiring occasional checks | Significant symptoms requiring regular treatment | Life-altering symptoms requiring specialized care |
| Resolves after 1d10 days | Resolves after successful Medicine roll | Becomes permanent trait unless treated at hospital |
| Minor impact on specific activities | Moderate impact on range of activities | Major impact on multiple aspects of function |

### MANAGING COMPLICATIONS
* Each complication can be treated with Medicine skill
* Success reduces severity by one step
* Critical success eliminates the complication entirely
* Specific equipment may be required for certain complications

## MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SIGNIFICANCE

Each piece of medical equipment provides tangible advantages:

### STANDARD EQUIPMENT

| Equipment | Function | Mechanical Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Medikit** | Basic diagnosis and treatment | Required for field treatment |
| **Medical Scanner** | Analyzes injuries and health | +20% to diagnosis checks |
| **Surgical Tools** | Enhanced treatment capabilities | Required for surgical procedures |
| **Auto-Medic** | Computerized treatment assistance | Can treat one additional patient simultaneously |

### SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT

| Equipment | Function | Mechanical Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Atomic Analyticator** | Advanced diagnostic system | Identifies optimal treatment combinations; +40% to diagnosis checks |
| **Portable Bio-Stabilizer** | Maintains patient stability | Delays symptom onset until GRIT check succeeds (checked hourly) |
| **Emergency Medical Nanites** | Microscopic repair robots | Provide 1 automatic success on treatment roll; 20% chance of complication |
| **Z-Ray Apparatus** | Experimental healing technology | Treats wounds at +20% but 30% chance of mutation |
| **Venusian Bio-Enhancer** | Accelerates natural healing | Doubles natural healing rate; -20% to complication checks |

## MUTATION TABLE

When treatments cause mutations (especially Z-Ray treatments), roll on this table:

| Roll (d20) | Mutation Effect | Game Impact |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1-3 | **Luminescent Skin**: Patient's skin glows faintly in darkness | Provides dim light in 5-foot radius; impossible to hide in darkness |
| 4-6 | **Accelerated Metabolism**: Patient processes chemicals quickly | +20% to resist toxins; requires double food rations |
| 7-9 | **Thermal Sensitivity**: Patient can detect minute heat variations | +20% to detect hidden life forms; -20% to resist heat damage |
| 10-12 | **Altered Circulation**: Patient's blood has unusual properties | Can function at 5 wounds instead of 4; bleeds more profusely (wounds from bleeder weapons +1) |
| 13-15 | **Neural Reconfiguration**: Patient's nervous system rewired | +10% to REFLEX checks; occasional involuntary twitches (20% chance during precision tasks) |
| 16-18 | **Cellular Elasticity**: Patient's tissues have unusual flexibility | Can squeeze through spaces half their size; skin bruises easily (+1 damage from impacts) |
| 19-20 | **Energy Resonance**: Patient's cells resonate with energy weapons | Can sense energy weapon charging within 50 feet; takes +1 damage from energy weapons |

## SAMPLE MEDICAL SCENARIOS

### SCENARIO 1: COMBAT TRIAGE

**SITUATION**: During a firefight with Venusian predators, both the captain and engineer have been injured. The captain has sustained a claw wound to the abdomen (2 wounds), while the engineer has a less severe bite to the arm (1 wound). The team needs to continue through the jungle for another six hours to reach their ship.

**DR. CHEN'S DILEMMA**:

For the captain:
1. **Kermitomine**: Gets the captain back to full function immediately, but they'll collapse when it wears off, potentially in a dangerous situation
2. **Synthetic Tissue**: Reduces wound, but leaves the injury site vulnerable if attacked again
3. **Trauma Pak**: Balanced option but requires an hour of rest the team can't afford

For the engineer:
1. **Stim-Shot**: Ensures full function for the journey back, but the crash will occur just as they reach the ship
2. **Vascular Sealant**: Stops bleeding but reduced dexterity might affect engine repairs if needed
3. **Minor treatment only**: Save supplies for the captain's more serious injury

### SCENARIO 2: RADIATION EMERGENCY

**SITUATION**: After an atomic drive malfunction, three crew members have been exposed to radiation. The medical bay has limited supplies, and Orbital Station Medical is 12 hours away.

**DR. CHEN'S DILEMMA**:

For the highest-exposed crewmember:
1. **Radiation Purge**: Most effective but will incapacitate them with fatigue
2. **Z-Ray Treatment**: Complete repair but risk of mutation
3. **Cryofreeze**: Guaranteed stability until reaching the station but one fewer crew member for journey

For the moderately exposed crewmembers:
1. **Universal Antitoxin**: Partial treatment with immune suppression risks
2. **Rationed Radiation Purge**: Split treatment between them, partial effectiveness
3. **Atmospheric Adaptor**: Minimal effectiveness for radiation but conserves critical supplies
