![Atomic Tomorrow Logo](https://claude.ai/chat/docs/images/atomic-tomorrow-logo.png)

*Blast off into interplanetary adventure in an atomic-powered rocket to the Future as it used to be!*

## WELCOME TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM OF 2025!

The atom has been harnessed, the planets conquered, and humanity has rocketed across the void between worlds. This is not the cramped, digital future of screens and virtual realities—this is the expansive future of gleaming rockets, daring explorers, and adventure among the stars!

In this retro-futuristic world, technology followed a different path than our own history. The digital revolution never happened; instead, the atom was mastered and space was conquered.

### EXPLORE AN EXCITING RETRO-FUTURE

- Pilot rockets powered by Chemical X, the revolutionary fuel that makes interplanetary travel a matter of days not months
- Navigate Venus's lush jungles, Mars's ancient canals, and Mercury's extreme metal-rich wastelands
- Encounter strange alien creatures, mysterious Forerunner artifacts, and the enigmatic Mysterians
- Visit Cloud Haven on Venus, the ancient ruins of Mars, the mines of Mercury, and the sprawling cornucopia of Ganymede

## GAME FEATURES

### UNIQUE CHARACTER CREATION

Create distinctive heroes with our four-column character system:

- **EPITHET** - What makes you extraordinary: Grizzled, Lucky, Two-Fisted, Brilliant, and more
- **PROFESSION** - Your expertise: Rocket Jockey, Mad Scientist, Solar Marine, Space Trader, etc.
- **ORIGIN** - Where you're from: Earth, Luna, Mars, Venus, the Belt, and beyond
- **BACKGROUND** - Your upbringing: Military Family, Frontier Homestead, Corporate Upbringing, etc.

### INTUITIVE D100 TASK RESOLUTION

Our elegant percentile-based system creates exciting outcomes without complex arithmetic:

- Roll equal to or below your skill percentage to succeed!
- **Critical** Doubles are critical: critical success if under your skill percentage - like rolling 33 when your skill is 65%; critical failure if over, like rolling 77 on the same skill
- **Special**  Any roll ending in 0 or 5 is special.  If under it's a special success, if over it's a special failure.

### ACTION-PACKED COMBAT

A fast-paced, theatrical combat system that focuses on dramatic outcomes:

- Abstract positioning with four ranges: Engaged, Near, Far, and Distant
- Weapon quality determines wound rating, with success quality potentially adding additional wounds
- Opposed rolls create dynamic exchanges
- Special maneuvers triggered by success quality

### DRAMATIC INJURY SYSTEM

The wound system creates tension without excessive bookkeeping:

- Characters can sustain up to 3 wounds with no penalties during combat
- Wound 4 = Incapacitation (character cannot act)
- Wound 5 = Dying
- A variety of medical treatments, each with benefits and side effects

### VEHICLE & SPACE TRAVEL

Take to the skies and stars with vessels from atmospheric flying boats to interplanetary rockets:

- Vector-based space combat emphasizing maneuver and positioning
- Distinctive ship types with special abilities
- Vehicle damage that affects critical systems
- Maintenance encounters that turn repair tasks into mini-adventures
