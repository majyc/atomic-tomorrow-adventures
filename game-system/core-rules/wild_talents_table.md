## WILD TALENT MECHANICS

Each Wild Talent includes specific limitations and costs that make them feel like scientific phenomena rather than magical powers.

### ACTIVATION COSTS
- **Strain Cost**: Using your Wild Talent always causes 1 Psychic Strain, regardless of success or failure
- **Aura Dependency**: Many talents have effectiveness tied to current Aura level
- **Concentration**: Most require sustained mental focus to maintain

### SAMPLE MECHANICS

**01. Mind Swap** - Duration limited to (Current Aura ÷ 10) minutes. Both bodies are unconscious during transfer. Range: line of sight only.

**04. Lie Detector** - Can store up to (Current Aura ÷ 20) questions' worth of truth-sense per day. Each use provides binary true/false only, not context.

**61. Perfect Mimic** - Can remember and duplicate up to (Current Aura ÷ 10) different people. As Aura diminishes, must "forget" stored patterns but can reacquire them later.

**25. Psychic GPS** - Accuracy degrades with distance: exact location within 1 mile, general area within 10 miles, rough direction only beyond that.

**40. Language Master** - Can hold (Current Aura ÷ 25) languages simultaneously in active memory. Learning new language beyond capacity causes oldest to fade.

**54. Secret Keeper** - Each secret learned permanently reduces maximum Aura by 1 point until secret is shared or forgotten through trauma.

**64. Quantum Oracle** - Answer accuracy tied to Aura level: 90%+ Aura = definitive answer, 50-89% = likely answer, below 50% = cryptic/unclear response.

**75. Skill Vampire** - Can hold stolen skills for (Current Aura ÷ 5) hours. Multiple skills reduce duration proportionally.

### INVOLUNTARY ACTIVATION
Wild Talents may trigger during:
- Extreme emotional stress
- Rolling doubles on any dice roll
- Physical contact with certain materials (varies by talent)
- Exposure to specific electromagnetic frequencies

### SCIENTIFIC LIMITATIONS
Unlike magical powers, Wild Talents follow consistent rules:
- **Range Restrictions**: Most limited by line of sight, physical proximity, or inverse square law
- **Duration Limits**: Effects tied to biological or physics constraints
- **Interference**: Electronic fields, certain materials, or other psychic activity can disrupt function
- **Fatigue Effects**: Repeated use causes measurable degradation in effectiveness

## GAMEMASTER NOTES

Wild Talents should feel like atomic age superpowers - incredible abilities with dramatic consequences. They're meant to be central to character identity and story development.

**Implementation Tips**:

- Powers with specific, measurable effects (like "Lie Detector") are easier to adjudicate than vague ones
- Abilities that create story complications are more interesting than pure advantages
- Consider how each power would be viewed by authorities, criminals, and ordinary citizens
- Wild Talents should occasionally activate at dramatically appropriate but inconvenient moments

The Rhine Institute has no standard protocols for Wild Talents - each case requires individual assessment and often leads to ethical dilemmas about containment versus freedom.
