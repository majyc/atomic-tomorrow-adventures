# CITY DOCUMENTATION CHECKLIST
## Atomic Tomorrow Adventures - Theme Park City Design

### CORE PRINCIPLE: The Magic Number 13
Each city should have **13 elements in each major category** - substantial enough to feel like a real place with depth and variety, yet organized enough for GMs to quickly find what they need during play.

---

## 1. FOUNDATION ELEMENTS (3 Required)

### 1.1 Theme Statement
- **What It Is**: One clear sentence defining the city's core theme/identity
- **Example**: "Classical Learning Meets Futuristic Research" (New Athens)
- **Requirements**: Must be visually distinct and immediately understandable

### 1.2 Visual Description
- **What It Is**: 2-3 sentences establishing the city's iconic look
- **Must Include**: Architecture style, key visual landmarks, environmental integration
- **Focus**: What makes this city instantly recognizable from others

### 1.3 Core Function

## 2. ADVENTURE ELEMENTS: THE RIDES (13 Required)

### 2.1 Structure Requirements
Each of the 13 "rides" must include:
- **Name**: Memorable, thematic title
- **Description**: 1-2 sentences explaining what it is
- **Character Appeals**: Specific hooks for different character archetypes
- **Adventure Potential**: Clear indication of what conflicts/challenges occur here

### 2.2 Ride Categories (Mix and Match for Variety)
Create 13 rides using diverse categories to avoid repetition:
- **Power Centers**: Government buildings, corporate headquarters, guild halls
- **Knowledge Hubs**: Libraries, universities, data centers, archives  
- **Industrial Sites**: Factories, refineries, transportation hubs
- **Social Spaces**: Markets, entertainment districts, residential areas

### 2.3 Character Appeal Distribution
With 13 rides, ensure good coverage across character types (aim for 2-3 rides per archetype):
- **The Ace Pilot**: Challenging navigation, vehicle opportunities, racing circuits
- **The Boy Genius**: Technical puzzles, research opportunities, invention testing  
- **The Roboticist**: Mechanical systems, automated processes, AI interactions
- **The Telekinetic**: Psychic challenges, mental barriers, consciousness-related mysteries
- **The Legendary Solar Ranger**: Wilderness knowledge, survival skills, tracking
- **The Sophisticated Diplomat**: Social challenges, politics, negotiation opportunities

**Strategy**: Some rides should appeal to multiple archetypes, while others might be specialist locations. The variety of 13 rides allows for both broad appeal and niche specialization.

### Template Structure

### Quality Check Questions
Before finalizing any city documentation:

1. **Theme Clarity**: Can someone immediately understand this city's identity?
2. **Visual Distinctiveness**: Would this city look obviously different from others?
3. **Adventure Density**: Are there clear opportunities for multiple session types?
4. **Character Coverage**: Can all party archetypes find engaging activities?
5. **Memorable Details**: What specific elements will stick in players' minds?
6. **GM Usability**: Can a GM quickly scan this and run adventures?
7. **Setting Integration**: How does this connect to the broader Venus setting?

### The 13-Element Breakdown per Category
- **Foundation**: Theme + Visual + Function (3 total)
- **Rides**: Adventure locations (13)
- **People**: Notable NPCs (13)  
- **Vistas**: Signature visual locations (13)
- **Trade**: Unique goods/services (13)
- **Context**: Inter-city connections (1)
- **Total**: 56 elements creating a rich, varied city

### GM Usage Strategy
With 13 elements per category, GMs can:
- **Use what they need**: Not every element needs to appear in every session
- **Create variety**: Multiple visits to the same city feel different  
- **Build depth**: Players can't memorize everything in one exposure
- **Generate surprises**: Always have unused elements for unexpected developments
- **Maintain freshness**: Cities remain interesting across multiple campaign arcs

This structure creates cities that feel genuinely lived-in and endlessly explorable while giving GMs abundant options for any type of adventure.
