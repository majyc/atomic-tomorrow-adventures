# **ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES**
## **VOLUME I: EXPLORER'S MANUAL**

*A Complete Player's Guide to Adventure in the Solar System of 2025*

---

## **WELCOME TO THE ATOMIC AGE**

It's the gleaming atomic future of 2025, and humanity has done what we always knew we would—spread across the solar system in gleaming rocket ships powered by atomic fire. Mars hosts bustling colonies beneath its red skies, Venus conceals ancient secrets in its steaming jungles, and the asteroid belt thrums with prospectors seeking their fortunes among the stars. This is the golden age of space exploration, where ray guns gleam, robots serve, and adventure waits beyond every planet's horizon.

You're explorers, adventurers, and heroes of this atomic tomorrow—rocket jockeys with nerves of steel, brilliant scientists with revolutionary theories, swashbuckling scouts who blaze trails across alien worlds, and countless other extraordinary individuals. The solar system needs people with grit, determination, and the courage to face whatever mysteries lurk in the dark between the worlds.

Whether you're hunting for ancient Martian artifacts, defending a Venus colony from saurian predators, or racing through asteroid fields to deliver vital supplies, your adventures will shape the future of humanity among the planets. The question isn't whether you'll find adventure—it's whether you'll survive it with your sanity intact and your atomic-powered dreams still burning bright.

## **CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION**

Creating a character in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures means building someone extraordinary: the kind of person who belongs in thrilling tales of atomic-age adventure. But here's the thing: you're not just rolling dice and assigning numbers. You're crafting a hero worthy of the atomic tomorrow, someone with the courage to face Martian death rays and the wit to sweet-talk a Venusian merchant prince out of his finest atmospheric silk.

The system uses four columns to define who you are, where you come from, and what makes you special. Think of it as choosing the fundamental elements that make your character unique; these four choices will determine everything from your skill set to your starting equipment to the kinds of adventures that call to you across the void between worlds.

### THE FOUR-COLUMN SYSTEM

Every character combines one choice from each of four columns to create a unique concept. Don't worry about memorizing every option right now—just understand that each column serves a different purpose in defining your character. Your **Epithet** describes what makes you exceptional; your **Profession** determines your skills and training; your **Origin** reflects where you were born and raised; and your **Background** shapes your upbringing and connections.

Here are all the options laid out for easy reference:

### COLUMN A: EPITHET

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. In the atomic age, ordinary people are already pretty remarkable. These are the qualities that make you the kind of person who gets called in when the ray guns start firing and the atomic rockets need piloting through asteroid fields. Each epithet grants special abilities and unique advantages that reflect your character's exceptional nature; think of them as the reason you're the hero of this story rather than just another face in the crowd at Luna City Spaceport.

#### Gritty/Tough Epithets

**Grizzled** (+2 GRIT): You have 1 extra wound on your track before incapacitation (5 wounds instead of 4).

**Hard-Bitten** (+1 GRIT, +1 NERVE): +20% resistance to environmental hazards and extreme conditions.

**Battle-Scarred** (+2 NERVE): Wounds never affect your initiative rolls, regardless of penalty level.

**Steely-Eyed** (+2 NERVE): In standoffs and intimidation contests, opponents need a critical success to shake you.

**Hardboiled** (+1 GRIT, +1 GUILE): Immune to emotional manipulation and can function without sleep for 48 hours with no penalty.

**Iron-Willed** (+2 GRIT): When you would normally be incapacitated by wounds, you can continue functioning by making a GRIT check each round. However, sustaining any additional wound immediately renders you unconscious.

**Two-Fisted**: Can fight effectively with a weapon in each hand and Parry/Block one additional time per turn with no penalty.

#### Skilled/Expert Epithets

**Crack**: In your primary professional skill, any roll of doubles or ending in 0 or 5 succeeds. +10% to all other professional skills.

**Hotshot** (+10% to three skills of your choice): Your show-off maneuvers succeed more often, granting +20% when attempting flashy actions.

**Virtuoso**: One professional skill at +20% above normal maximum. Critical successes on professional skill rolls create lasting positive reputation.

**Legendary**: Your name opens doors (+20% to social interactions where your reputation matters). After adequate preparation for a task within your expertise, you can perform one flawless execution.

**Peerless** (+10% to all professional skills in your field): After studying a problem in your field for at least an hour, you can attempt solutions that would be impossible for others.

**Uncanny**: Sixth sense for danger (+20% to detect ambushes, traps, and betrayals). Animals and children instinctively trust you.

#### Adventurous Epithets

**Intrepid** (+1 NERVE, +1 REFLEX): +20% to all exploration and pathfinding rolls.

**Swashbuckling**: +20% to acrobatic combat maneuvers. Can goad opponents into making mistakes by targeting their pride.

**Bold**: After any failure, gain +20% to your next roll if attempting a different approach. Recover from setbacks twice as quickly as normal characters.

**Daring**: +20% to genuinely dangerous actions. Never suffer special or critical failures when attempting risky actions.

**Audacious**: Can attempt normally impossible stunts at -40% instead of being automatically impossible. Your daring inspires allies, granting them +10% to their next action.

**Lucky**: When you fail a roll, any result ending in a 7 allows you to reroll (you can continue rerolling as long as you keep getting 7s). +20% to games of chance and randomized situations.

#### Clever/Smart Epithets

**Brilliant** (+2 SAVVY): When examining clues or evidence, you can make correlations others miss (+20% to deduction and analysis).

**Ingenious**: Can create impromptu tools from available materials on any successful SAVVY roll. Your jury-rigged solutions ignore the first Special Failure, breaking only on Critical Failures or a second Special Failure.

**Silver-Tongued** (+2 CHARM): Persuasion attempts that succeed create lasting belief changes rather than temporary compliance.

**Enigmatic**: People find it difficult to read you (-20% to others' attempts to analyze your intentions). Strangers often confide in you, sharing secrets they normally wouldn't.

**Veteran** (+1 GRIT, +1 SAVVY): Better situational awareness; you can detect ambushes on any successful roll, not just critical success.

#### Charming Epithets

**Plucky** (+1 CHARM, +1 NERVE): In any Social Contest trying to intimidate, frighten or overawe you, you reduce the degree of success score against you by 1.

**Seductive** (+1 CHARM, +1 GUILE): In Seduction Social Contests, Opposed wraps back around to Receptive (skipping Convinced). It's still not mind control, and NPCs can want you and still betray you or refuse you out of loyalty or scruples.

**Stunning** (+2 CHARM): You command attention. You are noticed wherever you go, unless heavily disguised. Villains prefer to capture or spare you rather than mar your beauty.

**Suave** (+1 CHARM, +1 SAVVY): Special and Critical failures on Social skills become ordinary failures.

**Well-Heeled** (+1 CHARM, +1 GUILE): When failing a roll that could be resolved with money, you may immediately make a GUILE check. Success means you find a way to throw credits at the problem and turn your failure into a success—but at double the normal cost.

### COLUMN B: PROFESSION

Your profession represents your training, expertise, and career focus: the work that pays the bills and shapes how you see the universe. But don't think of this as limiting; in the atomic age, a rocket jockey might also be an accomplished xenobiologist, or a space trader could have military training that comes in handy when pirates attack the convoy. Your profession determines your primary skill set and starting equipment while leaving plenty of room for growth and unexpected competencies.

### GENERATING ATTRIBUTES

After selecting your four columns, you need to determine your seven core attributes. These represent your basic capabilities and form the foundation for all your skills. Think of them as your character's raw potential before training and experience shape it into specific competencies. Don't worry if your numbers aren't perfect; in the atomic age, determination and ingenuity often matter more than raw ability.

#### The Seven Attributes

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, and athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, and reaction speed  
- **NERVE**: Mental composure and courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, and perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, and persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, and mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, and craftiness

#### Attribute Generation Methods

Your Origin determines how you generate attributes:

**TERRANS**: Must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 (distributed as you choose)

**ALL OTHER ORIGINS**: Roll 2d10 for each attribute and arrange as desired. Results below 3 become 3, and results above 18 become 18.

**TERRAN EXILES**: May choose to roll like other origins instead of using the Standard Array

## **CHAPTER 2: CORE MECHANICS**

Atomic Tomorrow Adventures uses a percentile dice system that emphasizes dramatic action and pulp adventure storytelling. In the atomic age, even routine tasks can become opportunities for heroic moments. The core concept is elegantly simple: you roll two ten-sided dice to generate a number from 01 to 100, trying to roll your skill percentage or under. But here's where it gets interesting: not all successes and failures are created equal, and the quality of your roll determines just how spectacular your achievement becomes or how badly you muffed it.

### THE CORE RESOLUTION SYSTEM

**Basic Resolution**: Roll percentile dice (d100) against your skill or attribute percentage. Roll equal to or under your percentage to succeed. Simple enough, right? But the devil (or in this case, the atomic-powered angel) is in the details.

**Success Quality**: The quality of your success affects the outcome, and this is where the system starts to sing. You're not just succeeding or failing; you're succeeding with style, failing with complications, or achieving something so spectacular that it becomes the stuff of legends.

| Quality           | Roll                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Automatic Success | 01-05                                              |
| Ordinary Success  | Roll is Skill percentage or less                   |
| Special Success   | Roll is success that ends in 0 or 5                |
| Critical Success  | Roll is success and is doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.)  |
| Failure           | Roll is greater than Skill percentage              |
| Special Failure   | Roll is failure that ends in 0 or 5                |
| Critical Failure  | Roll is failure and is doubles (66,  77, 88, etc.) |
| Automatic Failure | 96-00                                              |
|                   |                                                    |

Here's how it works: an ordinary success occurs when you roll your skill percentage or less—you accomplish exactly what you set out to do. Special successes happen when your successful roll ends in 0 or 5, representing that perfect moment when everything clicks into place. Critical successes occur when you roll doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.) under your skill percentage—these are the moments that legends are made of.

Failures work similarly, but with complications. Special failures are failed rolls ending in 0 or 5, while critical failures are doubles that exceed your skill percentage. These aren't just "you missed"—they're dramatic setbacks that move the story forward in unexpected ways.

Regardless of your skill level, rolls of 01-05 always succeed (automatic success) while rolls of 96-00 always fail (automatic failure). Even the most incompetent atomic engineer can have a moment of perfect clarity and sometimes it's better to be lucky than to be good, while even the most skilled and experienced can have that moment of inattention where you accidentally hit the wrong button at exactly the wrong moment.

**Success Effects**: Success quality determines the magnitude of your achievement, and this is where the system rewards both planning and spectacular dice rolls. An ordinary success accomplishes the base effect you intended—you hit the target, crack the code, or sweet-talk the guard. Special successes provide enhanced results, effectively adding one additional step of success to your effort. Critical successes deliver superior outcomes, adding two additional steps of success and often creating opportunities you hadn't even considered.

Conversely, special failures create complications and subtract one success from extended tasks—you're making progress, but something's gone wrong. Critical failures cause serious problems and typically eliminate all accumulated progress on complex endeavors, forcing you to start over with additional complications to overcome.

### DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS

All actions use this consistent scale of difficulty modifiers, because the atomic age throws everything from routine maintenance to desperate last-second heroics at our intrepid explorers. The key is keeping things simple while still rewarding proper preparation and acknowledging when circumstances are working against you:

| Difficulty | Modifier | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Trivial** | Don't Roll | Tasks so simple it would be a surprise if you failed |
| **Easy** | +20% | Favorable conditions, ample time, proper tools |
| **Routine** | +0% | Standard conditions with appropriate equipment |
| **Challenging** | -20% | Time pressure, improvised tools, unfavorable conditions |
| **Difficult** | -40% | Severe conditions, missing critical tools, under fire |
| **Extreme** | -60% | Nearly impossible circumstances, critically limited resources |
| **Heroic** | -80% | The stuff of legends, requires extraordinary effort |

Apply only the single most significant modifier rather than stacking multiple modifiers. This keeps the math simple and prevents situations where characters become helpless due to accumulated penalties—in the atomic age, heroes find ways to overcome obstacles, not excuses to give up.

### OPPOSED CHECKS

When two characters' skills directly oppose each other—whether it's a battle of wits, a contest of strength, or a tense negotiation over the price of Martian crystals—both participants roll percentile dice and let their skills do the talking. The higher successful roll wins, with success always trumping failure and better quality always trumping lesser quality. If both characters succeed with the same quality of success, the highest roll determines the winner—sometimes it really does come down to who rolled better.

Even when both characters fail, the lower roll represents a worse outcome than the higher one. Nobody succeeds at what they were trying to do, but somebody definitely looks more foolish doing it.

## **CHAPTER 3: SKILLS SYSTEM**

The unified skills system in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures balances natural talent with professional training, creating characters who feel both competent and specialized. Here's the core philosophy: everyone can try anything, but experts excel in their chosen fields. Your character might not be trained in xenobiology, but if alien spores are threatening the colony, you can still make an attempt based on your general scientific knowledge and desperate ingenuity. You just shouldn't expect to perform as well as someone who spent years studying off-world life forms.

### SKILL ORGANIZATION

Skills fall into two fundamental categories that reflect different aspects of human capability, and understanding this distinction is crucial to making the most of your character's abilities.

**Attribute-Based Skills** are directly tied to your natural talents—your Athletics skill depends on your BRAWN, your Piloting relies on your REFLEX, and so forth. These represent capabilities where raw talent provides a solid foundation even without formal training. For these skills, your untrained percentage equals your attribute times two, and your core value adds 5% to represent basic familiarity: (Attribute × 2) + 5%. A character with high REFLEX can probably handle most vehicles reasonably well, even if they've never seen a Martian hoverbike before.

**FLEX Skills** represent areas of knowledge that depend more on training and experience than raw talent. Whether you're brilliant or average, mastering xenobiology or ancient languages requires dedicated study and accumulated knowledge. Your untrained percentage in FLEX skills is only 10%—you're basically guessing—but your core value jumps to 25%, equivalent to having an attribute of 10 in an attribute-based skill. Being naturally smart certainly helps when studying history, but scholarly training in one academic specialty doesn't automatically make you competent in others like mathematics or medicine.

The beauty of this system is its optimism: most of the time, any character can attempt any action regardless of training. Never piloted a rocket ship? There's always a chance you'll figure it out when it matters! Never studied Martian archaeology? You can still make educated guesses about those strange hieroglyphs. The system assumes that characters in the atomic age are generally competent, resourceful people who can rise to challenges when circumstances demand it.

### PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

Your chosen profession reflects years of specialized training that significantly enhances related skills—this is where you separate the professionals from the enthusiastic amateurs. Your primary professional skill receives a substantial +40% bonus, representing your area of greatest expertise and the focus of your career. Secondary professional skills gain a +20% bonus, while tertiary skills receive +10%. These represent related areas where your professional experience provides significant advantages even if they weren't your main focus.

Your final skill percentage is simply your core value plus any applicable professional, origin, or background bonuses. The math is straightforward, but the implications are significant: a skilled pilot with a 75% chance of success isn't just "better" than an untrained character with a 35% chance—they're operating on an entirely different level of competency.

### SKILL CALCULATION EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Navigation (Space)**
- Character with SAVVY 14
- Navigation as Secondary Professional skill
- Core Skill: (14 × 2) + 5% = 31%
- With Secondary Professional Bonus: 31% + 20% = 51%

**Example 2: Academics (History)**
- FLEX skill with no special attribute influence  
- Academics as Primary Professional skill
- Core Skill: 25%
- With Primary Professional Bonus: 25% + 40% = 65%

If you have training, you use the most relevant specialized skill, or if none are applicable use the core value of your specialty.  E.g. If you have Engineering (Ships Systems) at 71% from a Core skill of 31 (Savvy 13 x 2 + 5) + 40 for your primary profession and you're called on to do some engineering on some medical equipment since it's outside of your specialty you'd roll vs your Core Value 31 instead of your full value of 71.

### SOLAR SCOUTS TRAINING

Every character starts with Solar Scouts Training at 35%, representing general survival and self-defense training they received in their youth. It covers unarmed combat, pistols, rifles, survival and first aid. It never improves directly, but critical successes while using Solar Scouts Training can lead to developing the full specialized skill.

### SKILL ADVANCEMENT

Skills improve through dramatic use rather than routine practice. Mark a skill for potential advancement when you roll a critical success, when you succeed at a particularly difficult task (Difficult penalty or worse), or when you succeed in life-threatening situations where failure would mean somebody's death.

At adventure's end, roll d100 against each marked skill's current percentage. If you fail this roll (rolling above your percentage), you've identified areas for improvement. Beginners with skills below 50% improve rapidly, gaining 10% each time. Skilled practitioners (50-69%) advance more slowly at 3% per improvement. Experts (70-89%) gain only 2%, while masters (90%+) inch forward by just 1% as they approach the limits of human capability.

---

## **CHAPTER 4: TASK RESOLUTION**

This system handles non-combat challenges that characters face, from bypassing security systems to performing emergency surgery or deciphering alien artifacts.

### PRINCIPLES OF TASK RESOLUTION

The task resolution system operates on four core principles that keep the action moving while maintaining meaningful challenges. Roll dice only when success is uncertain and failure carries real consequences—routine actions succeed automatically. All participants contribute directly to task completion rather than providing abstract bonuses, ensuring everyone stays engaged. Task difficulty and duration are separate considerations, allowing for quick complex tasks or time-consuming simple ones. Finally, tasks can be performed during combat or other high-pressure situations, reflecting the heroic competence of atomic-age adventurers.

### TASK DIFFICULTY CATEGORIES

Tasks are categorized by the number of successes required for completion. 

| Category  | Required Successes | Examples                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard  | 1                  | Hot-wiring a vehicle, treating minor injuries, or identifying strange minerals |
| Complex   | 3                  | Bypassing security systems, performing field surgery, or repairing damaged equipment |
| Demanding | 5                  | Deciphering alien codes, disarming sophisticated explosives, or hacking military computers |
| Expert    | 8                  | Delicate brain surgery, reconstructing ancient technology, or navigating treacherous asteroid fields |
| Master    | 13+                | Repairing severely damaged spacecraft, deciphering entire alien languages, or inventing a new technology. This sort of effort is likely to be the focus of an entire adventure, not usually resolved as a handful of rolls. |
|           |                    |                                                              |

### SUCCESS COUNTING

Success quality directly affects your progress toward task completion. Ordinary successes contribute one point, while special successes (successful rolls ending in 0 or 5) contribute two points. Critical successes—doubles under your skill percentage—contribute three points, potentially completing complex tasks in a single dramatic roll. Special failures subtract one accumulated success, representing setbacks and complications. Critical failures eliminate all accumulated progress and may render the task impossible if you've broken something crucial in your fumbling attempt.

### TIMEFRAMES

Time constraints add urgency and drama to task resolution.

Combat rounds lasting six seconds allow one attempt per round, perfect for bypassing blast doors during firefights or stabilizing wounded comrades under fire. Standard tasks spanning one to five minutes call for checks every minute, suitable for hot-wiring vehicles or picking locks while enemies approach. Extended tasks taking ten to sixty minutes use checks at meaningful intervals during activities like surgery, ship repairs, or prisoner interrogation. Prolonged efforts spanning hours or days require checks once per significant time unit (determined by the GM) such as when surveying crash sites, researching ancient artifacts, or constructing makeshift shelters.

### TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION

Collaborative efforts take two forms depending on the nature of the task. When one person clearly leads while others assist—such as a surgeon directing nurses during an operation—the primary operator makes normal skill rolls while assistants roll at -20%. Assistants contribute a maximum of one success per roll regardless of the quality of their success, representing their supporting role. Assistant's failures, even special failures, do not penalize the task, but their critical failures *do* count: the primary operator needs to make a quick unmodified roll against their skill: on a failure all progress is lost, while on a success they have averted disaster and the overall task only loses one success; on a critical success they don't even lose that. Remember, this is only triggered when an assistant critical fails.

For tasks where multiple people can contribute equally—like a team of archaeologists excavating a site—all participants make normal skill rolls and all successes count at full value. This distributed approach allows teams of specialists to tackle major challenges together. Each assistant should keep track of their own totals, since a critical failure will lose their entire contribution so far, but not all the failures of the team.

### COMPLICATIONS AND SETBACKS

Failures introduce complications that reflect the dramatic nature of atomic-age adventures. Special failures (failed rolls ending in 0 or 5) create minor setbacks, such as causing the loss of one previously accumulated success as circumstances work against you. Critical failures (doubles that fail) represent major setbacks, eliminating all accumulated progress and forcing you to restart the task—sometimes with additional complications.  The GM should come up with narratively plausible results to explain/describe the failure: the circuit board sparks and one of the components melts and needs to be replaced, rather than just you lose 1 success.

## **CHAPTER 5: COMBAT SYSTEM**

Combat in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures emphasizes dramatic action, heroic stunts, and the cinematic flow of pulp adventure stories. When ray guns start firing and atomic rockets start exploding, you want the action to flow like the best space opera serials. The system keeps things fast-paced while providing tactical options for clever players; whether you're swinging from the chandelier in a Venusian palace or diving behind cover as plasma bolts sear the air around you, the mechanics should enhance the drama, not slow it down.

### INITIATIVE AND TURN SEQUENCE

Combat begins with initiative rolls: each participant rolls a REFLEX check (percentile dice against REFLEX × 5). The highest successful roll acts first for the entire combat, followed by players proceeding around the table. This keeps everyone engaged and prevents any single player from dominating the action. To prevent staleness, alternate between clockwise and counter-clockwise each combat, ensuring that the same person doesn't always go last. Ties go to the character with higher REFLEX; after all, natural agility counts for something when atomic fire starts flying.

### ACTION ECONOMY

Each round grants characters significant freedom of action within realistic limits. Think "pulp fiction hero" rather than "ordinary person."  You still have to worry about the odds against you, and if somebody has the drop on you maybe you had better play along until you get an opportunity to escape, but you don't freeze up when it's crunch time.  You can take one significant action such as attacking, using a complex device, or employing a skill under pressure. You can also move within your current zone or advance toward an adjacent zone, plus perform one quick action like drawing a weapon, flipping a switch, or shouting a brief warning to your companions. The goal is to let characters feel competent and dynamic without bogging down in microscopic detail about every little movement.

### POSITIONING

Combat employs abstract positioning that emphasizes dramatic action over precise measurement. Counting hexes and measuring exact distances kills the flow of a good ray gun battle. Engaged range represents hand-to-hand combat distance where fists and blades dominate; you're close enough to see the fear in your opponent's eyes. Near range covers the same general area where pistols prove most effective: across a room, down a corridor, within the same space. Far range represents separate areas still within sight, but requiring three moves to close the distance, ideal for rifle combat and requiring three moves to transition from Near. Distant range demands significant movement to reach and presents difficult shots, requiring another three moves from Far. This is sniping territory or long-range spacecraft combat.

### ATTACK SEQUENCE

Combat resolution follows a straightforward three-step process that keeps the action moving while still providing meaningful choices. The attacker rolls against the appropriate Combat skill: Unarmed, Melee, or Ranged as the situation demands. Failed attacks miss with no effect, while special and critical failures mean something bad happens to the attacker (jammed weapon, stumble, exposed position). Successful attacks trigger the defender's choice: attempt to defend against the attack or accept the hit and its consequences. This creates a moment of tension where the defender must decide whether to risk a defense attempt or take their lumps.

### DEFENSE OPTIONS

Defenders have several options when facing attacks. Parrying requires a weapon or Unarmed Combat skill and works only against melee or unarmed attacks. Blocking demands a shield but grants a +20% bonus; you can block melee attacks only once per turn but can block ranged attacks repeatedly. Dodging works against any attack but suffers a -20% penalty against melee attacks due to the close quarters.

Multiple defensive actions become increasingly difficult—your first defense each turn uses full percentage, but each subsequent defense suffers a cumulative -20% penalty as fatigue and positioning work against you.

### OPPOSED RESOLUTION

When defense meets attack, compare the quality of success first—critical beats special, special beats ordinary. If both participants achieve the same quality of success, the highest roll wins. When results are completely identical, ties favor the defender, reflecting the advantage of being prepared for the incoming attack.

### DAMAGE AND WOUNDS

Weapons in the atomic age deliver precise, predictable damage through their fixed Wound Ratings (1-4) without requiring additional rolls. Base wounds equal the weapon's rating, but exceptional attacks increase this damage. Special success attacks add one additional wound, while critical success attacks add 2 wounds but ignores armor. These bonuses stack, so a critical special success—rare but devastating—adds both bonuses for maximum carnage.

Even after taking damage, tough characters can reduce incoming wounds through pure grit. Roll against GRIT × 5, with critical successes reducing wounds by three, special successes by two, and ordinary successes by one. Failure means you take the full brunt of the attack.

### WOUND EFFECTS

The wound system reflects the pulp adventure tradition where heroes remain effective until dramatically incapacitated. Characters with 0-3 wounds remain fully functional in combat, shrugging off hits that would fell ordinary people. At 4 wounds, incapacitation sets in—you're conscious but badly hurt. Characters with 5 wounds are dying and need immediate medical attention.

Incapacitated characters can still attempt heroic actions by making a GRIT × 1 roll. Success allows one normal action despite the wounds, while critical success removes all wound penalties for that action. Characters at death's door can attempt one final heroic act with a NERVE check—success grants one final action before collapse, while critical success allows the action without penalty and stabilizes the character at 4 wounds.

Once combat is over and the adrenaline fades, characters suffer a -20% penalty per wound to all actions, barring medical intervention, until the wound is healed.

### THE DUAL TRACK SYSTEM: WOUNDS AND STRAIN

Characters in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures track two types of damage: Wounds represent physical injury, while Strain reflects mental exhaustion, psychic feedback, and non-lethal trauma. Both tracks use the same five-step progression but affect characters differently.

| **Level** | **Wounds** | **Strain** |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **0-3** | Fully functional | Fully functional |
| **4** | Incapacitated | Mentally exhausted (-20% to all mental actions) |
| **5** | Dying | Unconscious |

**Strain Sources**: Strain accumulates from psionic backlash, environmental stress (extreme heat, cold, radiation), exhaustion, psychological trauma, non-lethal weapons, and certain drugs or toxins.

**Strain Effects**: Unlike wounds, strain primarily affects mental performance. At 4 strain, you suffer -20% to all SAVVY, NERVE, CHARM, and GUILE-based actions as mental fatigue clouds your thinking. At 5 strain, you fall unconscious from mental exhaustion.

**Strain Recovery**: Strain recovers more quickly than wounds. One point of strain recovers naturally after one hour of rest, or all strain can be removed with 8 hours of sleep. Some medical treatments and meditation techniques can accelerate strain recovery.

**Converting Between Tracks**: Some effects allow voluntary conversion between tracks. For example, psychics can sometimes dissipate strain by accepting physical wounds, while certain medical treatments might trade wounds for strain.

### NON-LETHAL COMBAT

Many conflicts in the atomic age involve stunning, capture, or subdual rather than outright killing. Non-lethal weapons and tactics inflict strain instead of wounds, allowing for dramatic confrontations without permanent consequences.

**Non-lethal Weapon Examples**: Stunners, shock batons, sonic disruptors, neural scramblers, and various gas weapons inflict strain damage. These weapons follow the same combat mechanics as lethal weapons but fill the strain track instead.

**Conversion Attacks**: Some weapons can be set to either lethal or non-lethal modes. Energy weapons often include "stun" settings, while projectile weapons might use tranquilizer rounds instead of bullets.

**Mixed Damage**: It's possible to suffer both wounds and strain simultaneously. A character might have 2 wounds and 3 strain, requiring careful management of both conditions.

### PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

Protection comes in two forms with different mechanics. Cover reduces the wounds dealt—partial cover reduces wounds from a successful attack by one, good cover by two, and excellent cover by three. Armor protection operates similarly in reducing incoming wounds. Light armor reduces wounds by one, medium armor by two, and heavy armor by three. Some advanced weapons possess armor-piercing properties that ignore portions of armor protection, reflecting the constant arms race between offense and defense in the atomic age.  Critical hits ignore both armor and cover.

**Environmental Positioning:**

Flanking, back-stabbing, attacking from a higher position, attacking with surprise, and any other situational modifiers should be decided by the GM on the fly, and if it's reasonable either the target should suffer a modifier to Defense or perhaps be unable to actively defend at all. In other cases one of the standard modifiers (-20, -40, etc.) should be applied. Often there should be an opposed role, say of Guile vs. Savvy, to check if the character has been sneaky enough to earn the bonus.

### SUPER-SIMPLE COMBAT MANEUVERS

Combat maneuvers add tactical depth without complexity through an elegant choice mechanism. When making any successful attack, the attacker can declare a desired effect instead of inflicting damage. If the attack succeeds, the defender faces a crucial decision: accept the declared effect (disarm, knockdown, push, etc.) or refuse and take normal damage instead.

Critical success attacks eliminate this choice—the defender must accept the declared effect and cannot opt for damage instead, representing the attacker's superior execution leaving no room for resistance.

Common maneuvers include disarming opponents, tripping or knocking them down, pushing them back a zone, pinning them in place, stunning them for a -20% penalty to their next action, snatching items, distracting them to prevent defensive actions next round, or repositioning them within the combat zone.

This system rewards clever tactical thinking. Players can set up advantageous situations through maneuvers, while NPCs typically accept effects less harmful than wounds. Some opponents possess specific vulnerabilities that make certain maneuvers particularly effective, encouraging players to observe and exploit tactical opportunities.  GMs should frequently have attacking NPCS choose maneuvers instead of straight up attacking; in the tradition of pulp adventure, even the baddest of bad-guys will usually opt to capture enemies, if only for the opportunity to gloat.

### SPECIAL WEAPON EFFECTS

Many weapons have effects that trigger on special or critical success. These effects represent the weapon's technology interacting with the target in unexpected or particularly effective ways.

| Weapon Type | Special Success Effect |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Laser** | Negates one additional level of armor reduction |
| **Plasma** | Area effect damage (adjacent targets take 1 wound) |
| **Sonic** | Target disoriented (-20% to next action) |
| **Cryo** | Target movement reduced by half |
| **Thermal** | Target catches fire (1 wound per round until extinguished) |
| **Ballistic** | Knockback effect (target moves back one position) |
| **Explosive** | Wider area effect |
| **Kinetic** | Target knocked prone |
| **Vibro** | Negates one additional level of armor reduction |
| **Impact** | Target stunned for 1 round |

### WEAPON PROPERTIES

Beyond their basic wound ratings, weapons possess various properties that affect their utility and tactical application.

| Property | Effect | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Armor Piercing** | Negates 1-3 levels of armor wound reduction | Usually found on military or specialized weapons |
| **Area Effect** | Affects multiple targets in same zone | May require special ammunition or power |
| **Concealable** | +20% to hide the weapon | Usually smaller and less powerful |
| **Non-lethal** | Can stun or incapacitate without causing wounds | Common in law enforcement weapons |
| **Reach** | Can attack from slightly beyond engaged range | Provides initiative advantage in first round of melee |
| **Silent** | Makes no noise when used | +20% to Stealth if used as part of a stealthy action |

### SPECIAL COMBAT SITUATIONS

Combat in the atomic age rarely takes place in ideal conditions. Space battles occur in zero gravity, while planetary adventures expose characters to hostile environments that affect tactical considerations.

**Zero-G Combat** presents unique challenges where traditional movement doesn't apply. Actions requiring movement use Athletics (Zero-G) skill instead of normal movement. Characters without this specialized training suffer a -40% penalty to physical actions, while those with high BRAWN find their strength working against them in weightlessness, suffering -5% per point of BRAWN above 10.

**Environmental Hazards** can quickly turn any encounter deadly. Vacuum exposure without protection causes 1 wound per round as the body struggles with decompression. Toxic atmospheres require regular GRIT checks to avoid poisoning, while radiation causes both immediate damage and long-term health effects. Extreme temperatures, whether the frozen void of space or the scorching surface of Mercury, require appropriate protective gear and GRIT checks to maintain effectiveness.

### AMMUNITION AND POWER

The atomic age has brought remarkable advances in portable power, but even the most sophisticated weapons have practical limitations that affect tactical planning.

| Weapon Class | Energy Weapons | Conventional Weapons |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Light Weapons** | 20 shots per power cell | 8-12 rounds per magazine |
| **Medium Weapons** | 15 shots per power cell | 15-30 rounds per magazine |
| **Heavy Weapons** | 10 shots per power cell | 5-10 rounds per magazine |
| **Specialized Weapons** | 5-8 shots per power cell | Varies by design |

Energy weapons offer the advantage of standardized power cells that can often be recharged at atomic power stations, while conventional weapons rely on manufactured ammunition that may be scarce in frontier regions.

### COMBAT EXAMPLE

Let's see how this works in practice with a classic atomic-age showdown:

**Situation**: Captain Steel faces off against a Mysterion agent in the corridors of an asteroid mining station. Ray guns at twenty paces!

**Round 1 - Initiative**: 
- Captain Steel (REFLEX 15): Rolls 42 vs 75% - Success, acts first
- Mysterion Agent: Rolls 88 vs 60% - Fails, acts second

**Captain Steel's Turn**: Our hero draws his trusty Blast Pistol (quick action) and fires at the agent (major action)

- Combat (Pistols) 65%: Rolls 30 - Special Success!
- Blast Pistol normally does 2 wounds, +1 for special, total 3 wounds

**Mysterion Agent's Defense**: The villain attempts to dodge behind a mining robot

- Athletics (Acrobatics) 50%: Rolls 67 - Fails
- Takes full 3 wounds, reducing him to 2 wounds remaining and looking pretty banged up

**Mysterion Agent's Turn**: Snarling with rage, he returns fire with his dreaded Disintegrator
- Combat (Energy Weapons) 70%: Rolls 25 - Special Success!
- Disintegrator does 3 wounds +1 for special = 4 wounds total

**Captain Steel's Defense**: Attempts to dive behind cover (Dodge)
- Athletics (Acrobatics) 55%: Rolls 41 - Success
- But here's the crucial part: Mysterion's special success beats Steel's ordinary success. Quality of success matters! Had Steel rolled a 45 (special success), he would have beaten the Mysterion's roll since the qualities would be the same, but his 45 is higher than the Mysterion's 25. Had he rolled a 44 (critical success), he would have flat out won against the Mysterion's special success regardless of the actual numbers.
- Steel takes 4 wounds and is incapacitated!

**Captain Steel's Last Stand**: At 4 wounds, attempts GRIT check to stay active
- GRIT 14 × 1 = 14%: Rolls 09 - Success!
- Can take one more action despite being incapacitated

This example shows how the quality of success matters in opposed combat, and how even tough heroes can be brought down by a good shot—but might still have one last chance to save the day! That's the atomic age for you: dramatic reversals and last-second heroics are all part of the adventure.

## **CHAPTER 6: EQUIPMENT & GEAR**

The atomic age has brought incredible technological advances to humanity. From ray guns that harness atomic energy to rocket packs that let you soar through the clouds of Venus, the equipment of 2025 combines scientific wonder with atomic-age style.

### WEAPON CLASSIFICATIONS

Weapons in the atomic age are classified by several characteristics that determine their effectiveness and utility. The **Type** indicates whether the weapon is designed for melee or ranged combat, while the **Class** (Light, Medium, or Heavy) reflects its size and power requirements. The **Wound Rating** (1-4) represents the base wounds inflicted, and **Special Properties** cover unique effects or tactical advantages.

Understanding wound ratings helps players choose appropriate weaponry for their missions. Rating 1 weapons include minor implements like improvised tools and small caliber firearms. Rating 2 represents standard personal weapons and common military arms that form the backbone of most arsenals. Rating 3 covers heavy military weapons and specialized combat tools requiring significant training. Rating 4 weapons are typically vehicle-mounted or extremely powerful devices that can devastate entire areas.

### RANGED WEAPONS

The development of portable atomic power has revolutionized ranged weaponry, creating everything from concealable hold-out blasters to devastating disintegrator rifles.

| Weapon | Class | Range | Special Properties |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Hold-out Blaster** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Concealable (+20% to hide) |
| **Dart Pistol** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Silent, can deliver toxins |
| **Stunner** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Non-lethal, GRIT check or stunned |
| **Signal Pistol** | Light (WR 1) | Far | Illuminates area, can start fires |
| **Blast Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Standard sidearm |
| **Laser Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Negates 1 armor level, silent |
| **Gauss Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Special: penetrates partial cover |
| **Sonic Disruptor** | Medium (WR 2) | Near | Area effect, ignores partial cover |
| **Thermal Projector** | Medium (WR 2) | Near | Special: target catches fire |
| **Blast Rifle** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far/Distant | Military standard |
| **Laser Rifle** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far/Distant | Negates 1 armor level, silent |
| **Plasma Caster** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far | Special: damages adjacent targets |
| **Disintegrator** | Heavy (WR 3) | Near/Far | Critical: +1 extra wound |

### MELEE WEAPONS

While ranged weapons dominate the battlefield, close combat remains essential when ammunition runs low or stealth demands silence. Atomic-age melee weapons combine traditional blade work with exotic technologies.

| Weapon | Class | Special Properties |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Combat Knife** | Light (WR 1) | Concealable (+20% to hide) |
| **Shock Gloves** | Light (WR 1) | Special: target stunned for 1 round |
| **Vibro-dagger** | Light (WR 1) | Negates 1 level of armor reduction |
| **Vibro-blade** | Medium (WR 2) | Negates 1 level of armor reduction |
| **Shock Baton** | Medium (WR 2) | Special: GRIT check or stunned |
| **Force Blade** | Medium (WR 2) | Negates 2 armor levels, requires power |
| **Vibro-axe** | Heavy (WR 3) | Special: +1 additional wound |
| **Power Hammer** | Heavy (WR 3) | Special: knocks target prone |
| **Force Sword** | Heavy (WR 3) | Negates 2 armor levels, parries energy weapons |

### STANDARD KITS

Rather than purchasing equipment piece by piece, most explorers find it more convenient and economical to start with a comprehensive kit suited to their expected missions. These packages provide essential gear at reduced cost while ensuring nothing critical is forgotten.

| Kit | Cost | Primary Contents | Specialization |
|-----|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Spacer's Kit** | 120 Cr | Vacuum suit, stunner, scanner, medikit, torch, radio | General space travel |
| **Explorer's Kit** | 150 Cr | Frontier suit, hoverscout, tent module, water reclaimer | Planetary exploration |
| **Scientist's Kit** | 100 Cr | Laboratory, analyzer, data reader, recorder, compounds | Research and analysis |
| **Medic's Kit** | 180 Cr | Advanced medikit, Z-ray wand, purge drugs, anesthetics | Medical emergencies |

## **CHAPTER 7: MEDICAL SYSTEM**

Medical treatment in the atomic age involves both miraculous cures and dangerous side effects. Every treatment decision carries risk and requires careful consideration of immediate needs versus long-term consequences.

### WOUND MECHANICS

Characters track wounds rather than hit points. Each wound represents a significant injury that affects your capabilities:

- **0-3 Wounds**: Fully functional
- **4 Wounds**: Incapacitated but conscious  (GRIT x 1 check to act)
- **5 Wounds**: Dying

### BASIC TREATMENTS

**Emergency Medikit**: Heals 1 wound with successful Medicine check. Standard medical equipment for field treatment.

**Miraclo Emergency Patches**: Advanced healing technology that can heal 2 wounds but carries a 10% chance of minor mutation.

**Stimulants**: Various drugs that can mask wound penalties or provide temporary enhanced performance, each with specific side effects and duration.

### MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS

When using advanced treatments, complications can occur based on special or critical failures:
- **Special Failures** (roll ending in 0 or 5): Standard complication occurs
- **Critical Failures** (doubles): Severe complication occurs  
- **Both together**: Critical complication requiring specialized treatment

### TREATMENT PHILOSOPHY

The medical system creates meaningful choices through treatment tradeoffs. When treating patients, doctors must balance immediate effectiveness against side effects and long-term complications, considering current circumstances and available facilities.

---

## **CHAPTER 8: PSIONICS**

Some humans have developed mental abilities beyond the normal range, perhaps due to cosmic ray exposure or evolutionary advancement. These psychic powers, or "psionics," are studied and regulated by the Rhine Institute.

### PSI SKILL

All psionic abilities use the Psi skill based on NERVE. Unlike other skills, using psionics depletes your Aura and can cause mental strain.

### THE FIVE DISCIPLINES

**Telepathy**: Reading and communicating through minds
- Basic: Sense surface thoughts, send simple messages
- Advanced: Deep mind reading, complex mental communication

**Telekinesis**: Moving objects with mental force  
- Basic: Lift small objects, apply gentle pressure
- Advanced: Manipulate heavy objects, create force barriers

**Precognition**: Perceiving possible futures
- Basic: Sense immediate danger, glimpse likely outcomes
- Advanced: Detailed future visions, probability manipulation

**Empathy**: Sensing and influencing emotions
- Basic: Read emotional states, project calm
- Advanced: Emotional manipulation, fear or courage inspiration

**Teleportation**: Instantaneous movement through space
- Basic: Short-range jumps, emergency escape
- Advanced: Long-distance travel, group teleportation

### AURA AND STRAIN

Each Esper has an Aura rating representing their mental energy reserves. Using psionics depletes Aura, and attempting to use powers when your Aura is too low causes Strain—the same mental exhaustion track explained in the Combat System chapter. Aura always starts at 100 (full capacity) and is reduced by psionic exertion: every time the Esper makes a roll for a psionic power, if the roll is less than the Esper's current Aura the roll becomes the Esper's new Aura; if the Esper is attempting an extended task where they have to make several rolls to accumulate successes only the final roll counts and is compared to Aura. If the roll is higher than the Esper's current Aura the Esper suffers from psychic backlash. Backlash adds one Strain to the Strain track, but does not change the Aura level since the roll is higher than the current Aura.

### AURA RECOVERY

- **Natural Recovery**: Aura resets to 100 after 8 hours without using Powered abilities
- **Meditation**: 1 hour of concentration, make NERVE check
  - Success: Reset Aura to 100
  - Special Success: Reset Aura to 100 and next Psi roll doesn't affect Aura
  - Critical Success: Reset Aura to 100 and next two Psi rolls don't affect Aura

### RESISTANCE

When psionic powers are used against unwilling targets, the target resists with checks against the most appropriate attribute. This creates an opposed roll situation with the following outcomes:

| **Attribute** | **Used Against** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **BRAWN** | Telekinetic forces trying to physically move or restrain |
| **REFLEX** | Powers requiring quick mental reactions or evasion |
| **NERVE** | Fear projection, emotional manipulation, or psychic pressure |
| **SAVVY** | Illusions, false sensory input, or deceptive suggestions |
| **CHARM** | Attempts to manipulate social dynamics or personal connections |
| **GRIT** | Direct mental attacks, pain induction, or psychic domination |
| **GUILE** | Mind reading, memory extraction, or deception detection |

**Opposed Roll Outcomes:**
- **Psychic succeeds, target fails**: Power works completely
- **Both succeed**: Higher successful roll wins
- **Both fail**: Nothing happens (no Aura change occurs)
- **Psychic fails, target succeeds**: Target may sense the attempt

### PSIONIC POWER APPLICATIONS

The following table provides guidelines for typical uses of psionic disciplines. Free uses require no roll and don't affect Aura, while powered uses require skill rolls and deplete Aura based on the result.

| **Discipline** | **Difficulty** | **Successes** | **Typical Applications** |

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**Dr. Sarah Voss (Mentalist, Psi Skill 65%, Current Aura: 100, Strain: 2)**

*Attempting to read the surface thoughts of a suspicious station worker*

**GM**: "This will require 1 success for basic surface thoughts. The worker isn't actively resisting, so no opposed roll needed."

**Player**: "I'll try to read what he's thinking about."

*Rolls 43 - Success*

**GM**: "You sense he's worried about something in Cargo Bay 7. Since your successful roll of 43 is under your current Aura of 100, no backlash. Your Aura is now 43."

*Later, attempting to probe deeper into his memories (3 successes needed)*

**Player**: "I want to find out what exactly he's hiding."

*First roll: 67 (success) - 1 success* *Second roll: 23 (success) - 2 successes*
 *Third roll: 78 (success) - 3 successes*

**GM**: "You successfully probe his memories and discover he's been smuggling Rhine Institute contraband. Your final successful roll was 78, which is higher than your current Aura of 43, so you suffer backlash - advance 1 step on your Strain track. Your Aura stays at 43."

**Player**: "That puts me at 3 strain total, so I want to try to dissipate my strain so I can keep using my abilities effectively."

*Rolls GRIT check: 34, success but less that current Aura so her aura becomes 34. If the Grit check had succeeded but the roll was higher than 43 the strain would be removed but she would gain one wound*

**GM**: "You grit your teeth and force the psychic feedback to manifest physically. Your nose starts bleeding, but your strain drops to 0 and your Aura becomes 34."

### LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The Rhine Institute registers and monitors psychics, providing training and legal protection in exchange for documentation and occasional service. Unregistered psychics face legal difficulties but avoid institutional oversight.

### COMBAT SEQUENCE
1. Roll Initiative (REFLEX × 5) then go around the table starting from whoever rolled highest success.  NPCs go when going around the table gets to the GM's seat.  If there are a number of NPCs rather than having them all cluster together and go on the GM's turn, the GM may choose to spread some of them out between the other players.
2. Each player Declares Actions, then resolves them
3. Once every character PC or NPC has gone, the GM resolves any environmental effect or hazards, and describes any changes to the scene such as new arrivals or changing conditions

### WOUND TRACK
- 0-3 Wounds: Fully functional
- 4 Wounds: Incapacitated (GRIT × 1 to act)
- 5 Wounds: Dying (NERVE check for Last Stand)

### TASK DIFFICULTY
- Standard: 1 success
- Complex: 3 successes  
- Demanding: 5 successes
- Expert: 8 successes
- Master: 12+ successes
