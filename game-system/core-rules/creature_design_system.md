# ATOMIC TOMORROW: CREATURE DESIGN SYSTEM

*A comprehensive system for creating memorable creatures that integrate seamlessly with the d100 resolution mechanics.*

## THE FOUR-COLUMN CREATURE SYSTEM

Create any creature by selecting one option from each column, just like character creation:

| **EPITHET** | **LOCOMOTION** | **BEHAVIOR** | **BIOME** |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| *(What makes it extraordinary)* | *(How it moves)* | *(Its ecological role)* | *(Where it lives)* |

**Example**: *Ravenous Leaping Ambush Predator from the Fungal Forest*

## SCALE SYSTEM & CONTESTS

### Creature Scales
Creatures have **Scale ratings** in three areas where relevant:
- **Brawn Scale**: Physical strength and size contests
- **Reflex Scale**: Speed and agility contests  
- **Speed Scale**: Chase and escape contests

### Scale as Success Armor
A creature's Scale rating acts as "success armor" - it automatically reduces the total successes achieved by opponents before comparison.

#### Brawn Scale (Size and Strength Contests)
**Scale 0**: Tiny size (insects, small birds) - Humans gain +20% 
**Scale 1**: Human-sized strength (dogs, humans, small cats) - Normal contests
**Scale 2**: Large, powerful (bulls, big cats, giant beetles) - 2 success armor
**Scale 3**: Huge, mighty (elephants, titan beetles) - 3 success armor  
**Scale 4**: Colossal strength (kaiju) - 4 success armor

#### Reflex Scale (Agility and Reaction Contests)
**Scale 0**: Sluggish reflexes (slow, clumsy movements) - Humans gain +20%
**Scale 1**: Normal agility (human-level reflexes) - Normal contests  
**Scale 2**: Quick reflexes (cat-like agility, hard to hit) - 2 success armor
**Scale 3**: Lightning fast (hummingbird-quick, blur of motion) - 3 success armor
**Scale 4**: Impossibly agile (teleport-fast reactions) - 4 success armor

#### Speed Scale (Chase and Escape Contests)
**Scale 0**: Very slow (snail-pace, nearly stationary) - Humans gain +20%
**Scale 1**: Normal speed (human walking/running pace) - Normal contests
**Scale 2**: Fast mover (horse-speed, hard to catch) - 2 success armor  
**Scale 3**: Racing speed (cheetah-fast, escape artist) - 3 success armor
**Scale 4**: Blur of speed (impossible to outrun or corner) - 4 success armor

### Contest Resolution

**Step 1**: Determine if humans can contest at this scale
- Impossible tasks (human vs kaiju strength) simply cannot be attempted
- Possible but difficult tasks proceed to Step 2

**Step 2**: Roll for successes and apply scale armor
- Each participant rolls their skill
- Count total successes (Critical = 3, Special = 2, Ordinary = 1)
- Subtract creature's Scale rating from human total
- If humans still have successes, proceed to Step 3

**Step 3**: Compare best rolls
- Humans use their single best successful roll
- Creature automatically rolls 50 for comparison
- Higher roll wins the contest

### Group Contests Example
**Three humans trying to push aside a Scale 2 Bull Beetle:**

*Human rolls*: 33 (Critical = 3 successes), 47 (Ordinary = 1 success), 78 (Failure = 0 successes)
- **Total**: 4 successes
- **After Scale 2 armor**: 2 successes remaining
- **Best human roll**: 33 vs creature's 50
- **Result**: Humans succeed but barely - they manage to shift the massive beetle with tremendous effort

## CREATURE STAT BLOCKS

### Simple Format
**Ravenous Leaping Ambush Predator from Fungal Forest**
- **Scales**: Brawn 1, Reflex 2, Speed 2  
- **Epithet**: Frenzies when wounded (+20% attack, -20% defense)
- **Wounds**: Healthy → Injured → Disabled → Defeated
- **Special**: Spore cloud attacks, perfect forest camouflage

### Usage Notes
- Only assign Scale ratings where relevant to likely encounters
- Most creatures don't need all three scales defined
- Epithet abilities override normal limitations
- Biome provides environmental advantages and context clues

## QUICK GENERATION

**Random Generation**: Roll d20 for each column, or pick thematically appropriate options.

**Themed Generation**: Start with biome, then select complementary traits.

**Encounter-Driven**: Choose epithet first based on desired challenge type.

**Examples**:
- *Stealthy Climbing Pack Hunter from Crystal Caves* (intelligent crystal-adapted apes)
- *Placid Swimming Grazer from Thermal Springs* (peaceful giant aquatic herbivore)  
- *Gigantic Stomping Territorial Guardian from Volcanic Mudflats* (kaiju-scale defender)
- *Cunning Burrowing Ambush Predator from High Desert* (trap-setting subterranean hunter)

This system provides infinite creature variety while maintaining mechanical consistency with the core d100 system.
