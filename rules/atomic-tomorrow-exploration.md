# ATOMIC TOMORROW: FRONTIER HEXPLORATION SYSTEM

## VISIBILITY TIERS & CARD DRAWING

### Low Visibility Terrain (Jungle, Canyons, Fog)

* **Draw NO feature cards**
* Can only see current hex
* Must follow terrain features or make navigation checks
* Examples: Dense Venusian jungle, Martian dust storm areas, Mercury crevasse fields

### Standard Visibility Terrain (Plains, Desert, Hills)

* **Draw ONE feature card**
* Card shows what's visible from current position
* Can make informed decisions about one direction
* Examples: Martian plains, Venus plateaus, Mercury flats

### High Visibility Terrain (Mountains, Towers, Plateaus)

* **Draw ONE feature card in each "forward" direction**
* Can determine adjacent terrain with hex flower rolls before moving, but only roll if they announce they head in that direction.
* Strategic advantage in planning
* Examples: Mountain peaks, observation towers, elevated plateaus

## STREAMLINED EXPLORATION PROCEDURE

### 1. ENTER NEW HEX

* GM rolls on appropriate hex flower for terrain type
* Places terrain index card on growing map
* Draws feature card ONLY if visibility permits

### 2. DETERMINE WHAT'S VISIBLE

Based on visibility tier:

* **Low** : Nothing beyond current hex
* **Standard** : Features on ONE direction card
* **High** : Features on ONE direction card in each adjacent terrain

### 3. PLAYER DECISIONS

* Choose which visible feature to move toward (if any)
* Explore current hex thoroughly or move on
* Navigate using visible features or planetary navigation aids

## THE FEATURE CARD

Each feature card shows one visible feature, in the direction where the card is placed

* Position indicates relative direction from current hex
* Only drawn when visibility allows

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

 **GM** : "You've landed in a Martian canyon. This is low visibility terrain, so you can only see what's in your immediate hex - red rock walls rising on either side, a dry riverbed beneath your feet, and some ancient carvings on the canyon wall."

 **Player 1** : "Let's follow the canyon and see where it leads. Seems like a natural path."

 **GM** : "You follow the winding canyon for several hours. I'll roll on the hex flower to determine where it leads." *Rolls* "The canyon gradually widens and opens into a broad Martian plain. This is standard visibility terrain."

*Places new blank terrain index card and marks it with the type and feature*

*Draws one new feature card for what's visible in the distance*

"From this vantage point, you can see an abandoned outpost to the north, strange rock formations to the southeast, and what appears to be a dust storm on the horizon to the west."

 **Player 2** : "The outpost might have supplies or information. Let's head that way."

 **GM** : "You travel north toward the outpost. I'll roll on the hex flower again." *Rolls* "As you approach, you find yourself in rocky badlands terrain with the outpost sitting atop a small rise."

*Places new blank index card and marks it up*

"This is still standard visibility terrain, so I'll draw one feature card again."

*Draws one feature card*

"From here, you can see a glinting object that might be a crashed ship to the northeast, a dried canal to the northwest, and a strange red haze to the east."

 **Player 3** : "Let's explore the outpost thoroughly before moving on."

 **GM** : *Draws Opportunity Card* "Searching the outpost, you find an old solar-powered radio relay station. It's been abandoned for years, but some of the equipment might still be salvageable. You also discover a weathered map showing the locations of several other outposts in the region."

 **Player 1** : "After we finish here, I want to head up that rise to the south - it looks like it might give us better visibility of the surrounding area."

 **GM** : "You climb the rocky hill south of the outpost. This elevated position counts as high visibility terrain."

*Draws one feature card*

"From this vantage point, you can see a massive crater to the south with what appears to be some kind of structure at its center, a dust canyon to the southeast, and the glint of water or ice to the southwest."

"Since this is high visibility terrain, you can also get a sense of the surrounding landscape. I'll roll on the hex flower for the adjacent hexes."

*Rolls for adjacent hexes*

"The area to the south appears to be impact crater terrain, to the southeast is dust canyon, to the southwest is a small oasis, and the other directions are various types of rocky plains.

## VENUS: THE JUNGLE WORLD

### Venusian Environmental Factors

* **Endural Treatment** : Players using Endural can operate in Venus pressure with minimal penalties
* **Weak Magnetosphere** : Compasses unreliable
* **Perpetual Cloud Cover** : Navigation by stars or satellites remains impossible
* **Lush Vegetation** : Thick jungle canopies limit visibility in many areas
* **Retro-Pulp Bio-hazards** : Focus on exotic flora/fauna rather than pressure/acid hazards

### Venus Navigation Methods

* **Bio-Navigation** : Learning to read distinctive plant patterns and animal migration routes
* **Natural Landmarks** : Massive trees, crystal formations, and distinctive geographic features
* **Indigenous Guidance Systems** : Methods used by native Venusians to traverse the jungles
* **Water Current Mapping** : Following the planet's extensive river systems

This revised approach embraces the atomic-age pulp version of Venus as a lush jungle world where Endural allows exploration but still maintains the unique navigational challenges of a cloud-covered planet with no magnetic navigation.

## PLANET-SPECIFIC HEX EXPLORATION TRAITS

### Venus Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Smaller (dense foliage limits visibility)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Visual landmarks and bio-signs instead of technical instruments
* **Unique Advantage** : Abundant natural resources (food, water, medicinal plants)
* **Primary Hazard** : Exotic life forms and territorial species
* **Discovery Focus** : Biological specimens, ancient ruins, strange plant phenomena

### Mars Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Medium (clear atmosphere but varied terrain)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Dust storms that reconfigure landmarks
* **Unique Advantage** : Ancient canal system provides reliable navigation framework
* **Primary Hazard** : Resource scarcity and ancient defense systems
* **Discovery Focus** : Forerunner technology, water sources, Red Martian artifacts

### Mercury Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Large (excellent visibility but extreme range of conditions)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Day/night cycle creates drastically different landscapes
* **Unique Advantage** : Rich mineral deposits and unmatched solar power
* **Primary Hazard** : Extreme temperature fluctuations
* **Discovery Focus** : Rare metals, untouched geological formations, stellar observation points

The exploration system now embraces the retro-futuristic vision of the Solar System where Venus is a jungle paradise (with appropriate challenges), Mars is a dying world of ancient canals and lost civilizations, and Mercury is a world of extremes with valuable resources for those hardy enough to brave its conditions.

Is this more aligned with the Atomic Tomorrow vision of Venus you're creating?

# ATOMIC TOMORROW: PLANETARY HEX SCALES & TRAVEL RATES

## EARTH (BASELINE)

* **Standard Hex Size** : 2 miles (approximately 3.2 km) across
* **Standard Travel Rate** : 3-4 hexes per day on foot through average terrain
* **Vehicle Travel Rate** : 6-10 hexes per day with ground vehicles on established paths

Using these Earth values as our foundation, let's adjust for the different planetary conditions:

## VENUS

* **Hex Size** : 1 mile (approximately 1.6 km)
* **Rationale** : Dense jungle and limited visibility require smaller-scale mapping
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: 2-3 hexes per day (slower due to vegetation but standard gravity)
* River Travel: 4-6 hexes per day following waterways
* Hovercraft: 5-7 hexes per day in cleared areas
* **Special Considerations** :
* Endural allows normal human exertion despite atmospheric conditions
* Certain plant species can be used as natural paths (fungal highways, vine bridges)
* Standing water and mud increase travel difficulty in lowland areas

## MARS

* **Hex Size** : 3 miles (approximately 4.8 km)
* **Rationale** : Lower gravity (38% of Earth) increases travel distance; clear air improves visibility
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: 4-6 hexes per day (benefit of lower gravity)
* Canal Routes: 5-7 hexes per day following ancient waterways
* Ground Vehicle: 8-12 hexes per day on established paths
* Thoat (Martian mount): 6-9 hexes per day across open terrain
* **Special Considerations** :
* Dust storms can reduce travel to 0-1 hexes during peak conditions
* Ancient roads and canal paths provide established travel routes
* Thin atmosphere means less stamina despite lower gravity

## MERCURY

* **Hex Size** : 4 miles (approximately 6.4 km)
* **Rationale** : Excellent visibility, lower gravity, but extreme conditions
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: Variable by temperature conditions
  * Terminator Zone (dawn/dusk): 5-7 hexes per day
  * Day Side: 1-2 hexes per day (heat limitations)
  * Night Side: 2-3 hexes per day (energy consumption for heating)
* Skimmer: 10-15 hexes per day on smooth plains during optimal conditions
* **Special Considerations** :
* Day/night travel rates drastically different
* Must plan routes around thermal shelters
* Solar power abundance on day side can boost vehicle range
