## **CONCLUSION**

The manuscripts are in excellent shape overall, with comprehensive coverage of most game systems and setting information. The primary gap is the detailed rocketship catalog, which represents substantial gameplay content that should be integrated into Volume II.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize rocketship catalog integration
2. Expand NPC and adventure content as needed
3. Use this checklist for future content audits
