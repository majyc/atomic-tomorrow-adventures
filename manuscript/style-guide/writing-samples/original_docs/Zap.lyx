Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is a role playing game where the players take the part of science fiction
 adventurers.
 It is meant to give the players and GM the tools for playing and producing
 results that feel like science fiction without bogging them down in unnecessary
 detail, and without making them sacrifice concept to conform to the rules.
 Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is based on the SFX!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

game system, as used in Kapow! and Argh!, though knowledge of either is
 not necessary to play; players familiar with other SFX! games
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

will find Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

quiet easy to pick up, though there are minor differences to fit the genre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Primary Rule of Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is that actions have to make sense in a science fiction kind of way and
 the players will continually be asked to describe their actions in terms
 that fit the conventions of the genre.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

it isn't enough to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I attack with my Telekinesis, that's 2d6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

asks you to describe how you're using your power, almost as if you were
 narrating the action in a science fiction story: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I use my Telekinesis to try to shove the alien marauder out the airlock,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Since the robot seems too heavy for my Telekinesis to lift, I use it to
 throw the release lever on a nearby cargo crane, dropping a load of plas-steel
 girders on him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 When in doubt, ask yourself 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does this sound like something from a science fiction story?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The Primary Rule applies to the plausibility of actions, particularly the
 results of actions involving science fictional powers and how they interact
 that are far outside of the realm of ordinary physics or common sense;
 it is not intended to force a particular outcome or story, or to substitute
 collaborating on SF fan-fiction for role playing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is simple enough for novices to play, though perhaps not simple enough for
 Game Masters with no prior experience in role-playing games.
 It's assumed that the players know what SF adventures are about and what
 sort of game they want to play.
 It's particularly important for the players and the GM to be on the same
 page about genre conventions such as whether adventurers are frequently
 killed by the dangers they face or generally triumph, and to what extent
 the player characters actions can change the world.
 If one player wants a game where the struggle to keep the megacorporations
 from hunting them down and destroying the cyberpunk rebellion is a losing
 battle, and another wants to play the laser-sword wielding bad-ass who
 topples stellar empires and restores the republic before breakfast, it's
 unlikely that they can both be satisfied with the same campaign.
 This sort of conflict of expected tone should be resolved before play begins.
 It should be the goal of everybody at the table to play up and play into
 whatever approach the players want to take.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

includes everything you need to create adventurers and explore strange new
 worlds: rules for character generation, campaign scope, super-science and
 alien powers and character templates, vehicles, bases, adjudicating actions
 and resolving combat, commerce, designing a setting, science fiction campaigns,
 sample alien creatures, organizations and non-player characters, and some
 adventure seeds and character sheets.
 Also included is some analysis of the probabilities for players who worry
 about that kind of thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

uses a straightforward mechanic to resolve most actions: you roll some dice
 (two, unless you're doing something unusual) and take the best.
 If you are pitting one Power against another you compare that to the best
 roll of the opposing Power; if unopposed then against a Difficulty based
 on the scale of what you're attempting.
 For instance, Ace Astra tries to jury-rig a microwave satellite relay dish
 she found at the crash site into a maser using her Science! power and fire
 it at the amorphous blob creature that consumed the crew of the crashed
 ship; the blob uses its Amorphous Form to resist.
 Ace rolls a 7 and the Blob rolls a 3...and the Blob takes a burst of microwave
 radiation straight to its nucleus.
 Note that in the example Ace isn't required to make a separate roll to
 jury-rig the microwave dish into a maser first, or figure out how to use
 a maser, that's assumed to be part of the description of her Science!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

attack on the blob; if there's some doubt that she really could aim the
 maser, perhaps because the dish is too big to swing around easily, she'd
 just describe a different method such as luring the blob into the dish
 before activating it, and the die roll would be the same.
 Nor should there be any rolls or back-and-forth over whether a microwave
 dish really could be changed into a maser safely, or at all without proper
 tools and extensive work; it sounds like the kind of thing that people
 get away with in science fiction adventures, and by the Primary Rule that's
 sufficient.
 Later Ace has to try to pull her best friend Unit-X3Z7, dangling above
 the matter annihilation chamber, to safety; the GM decides that's a Difficulty
 3 task, against which she decides to roll her Athletic Prowess.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the rest of the rules consists of deciding which dice of what size
 to roll for various actions, and what the results of success are, plus
 some handling for some of the more common unusual situations that heroes
 find themselves in, such as attempting to intimidate foes into giving up
 without striking a blow, or interfering with their powers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book consists of three sections: Creating a Character, Playing Zap!,
 and Game Mastering.
 The first two sections contain all the rules of the game, on how to create
 and how to play characters using Zap!, while the final part contains advice
 on running SF campaigns applicable to most systems.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Primary Rule
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is that actions have to make sense in an SF kind of way.
 It will be referred to a lot in the following rules, because it's a departure
 from the way many RPGs handle mechanics and dice rolling.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you don't even roll the dice if the action is obviously something a character
 with that Power or Shtick can do.
 Where in most RPGs you wouldn't bother rolling to see if you could walk
 across a room or sit in a chair, Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

extends that notion so that you won't bother rolling to see if your helmsman
 can plot an efficient course out of orbit, or your scientist can successfully
 research a device that will track the rampaging energy being; protagonists
 in SF adventures aren't confronted with situations where bad luck or failure
 to perform up to their usual standards (a bad die-roll) prevents them from
 continuing the adventure...though whether they will survive is open to question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrariwise, where other RPGs might just leave it up to the dice to decide
 whether an Esper's Mind Control can work against a robot (rolling damage
 vs.
 its mental resistance) or decide it based on whether the character had
 paid extra for the Mind Control when it was created to have it work against
 robots, Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

will ask the players the consider the plausibility of the action before
 they commit to it and roll the dice, and the decision may turn on details
 of the description of the robot such as whether it has an artificially
 intelligent positronic brain or simply carrying out the instructions of
 its programming.
 If given the particular robot's description it can't plausibly be controlled
 by the Esper, the Esper's psychic power can't work no matter how powerful
 it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the player will often be able to control whether an action
 can be taken according to the Primary Rule by the way they describe how
 they're employing their Power.
 In fact, that's the point of the Primary Rule: to require the players to
 narrate their actions in a more interesting way than just announcing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I use my Flame Blast, that's a d6, d6 attack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by making the details of the narration matter.
 This also helps novice role-players, who naturally tend to do this.
 To further this goal, and speed things along, final decisions as to the
 plausibility are placed in the hands of the player.
 The GM can suggest reasons that the action as described might not be all
 that plausible or should take into account facts about the situation such
 as the alien hovering fifty feet in the air, but the GM won't override
 the players unless she knows something they don't that makes the action
 impossible (such as the characters are actually fighting a hologram).

\begin_layout Description
Give your character a personality It needn't be anything elaborate, and
 you don't have to put on an accent, change your speech patterns, or even
 speak in the first person (though all those can add something), but it's
 more fun for everybody at the table when the characters are memorable,
 and people can derive a lot of satisfaction out of recognizing when a character
 is doing something that typifies the character's established personality
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

) and even more when they manage to predict and take advantage of that (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I knew Merath would go along with that plan, because she gets to dress up
 as the princess and boss everybody around
\begin_inset Quotes erd

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Don't make your character a jerk unless you're absolutely sure of your ability
 to entertain the other players and GM with the character's jerkiness.
 It's OK to be the character that everybody loves to hate, but it's not
 cool for anybody to actually hate it when you play that character.
 When you're gaming with friends they'll probably put up with your character
 making everything less fun for everybody but you, at least for a while,
 but that's no excuse.
 Even if you are sure that it's entertaining and not too disruptive, it
 would be wise to limit the jerk aspect to specific situations (the character
 goes on a bender after successful adventures) and not just be all-around
 unpleasant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Make your character a team-player unless you're playing solo.
 Loners aren't necessarily jerks, but in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

your character is going to be part of a team, even if it's not a formal
 team, and it screws up the game if the character keeps going off away from
 everybody else and makes the GM split attention between what the loner
 is doing and then what the rest of the party is doing.
 Every team needs a Han Solo, but the thing is even though he might have
 groused, or even quit, when it came time to act he was there and pulling
 his weight.
 If your character needs some alone time to be true to the character, see
 if your GM is amenable to doing that between play sessions.
 That might be brief play-by-email, or it might just be a couple of sentences
 at the start of the session

\begin_layout Description
Make the character a self-starter and give her a clear Drive.
 Everything is easier for the GM if the character can be counted on to have
 certain buttons that can be pushed.
 On the flip side, don't give the character Drives that are incompatible
 with the plot or tone of the game, at least without consulting the GM and
 other players first, unless you're quite prepared to play out how the character
's goals are frustrated.
 If the campaign is about providing emergency medical assistance to the
 varied sophonts of the local star cluster, it's perfectly fine if your
 character's Background
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Background
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is exiled ruler of a distant Star Kingdom, but if your Drive is to get
 restored to the throne it can amount to an attempted hijacking of the campaign
 if you dig in your heels and ignore the plight of the local cluster residents
 while trying to turn every adventure into a quest to return to your realm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Don't be a afraid to retire a character.
 If you're a design-in-play player who can't really set out to make a character
 with a given personality or approach, some of the above advice might seem
 hard to carry out.
 You might not have set out to create a jerk or a loner, but as play progressed
 you found that's what the character has become.
 If that happens, and you can't see a way to nudge the character you've
 envisioned into something the other players can enjoy playing with, it's
 time to let that character go.
 The loner can go off and be alone, and you can create a new character and
 try again.
 And even if you're not design-in-play, and had the character all figured
 out with a ten-page back-story before you sat down at the first session,
 if you're at all into thinking about the inner life of the character there
 may come a point where events in the game mean that what the character
 would do is leave the group.
 Characters quitting and eventually returning (or not) is a staple of the
 science fiction genre.
 So let the character leave, and maybe you'll pick it up again if in-game
 events bring the character's goals or location and the party's back in
 sync.
 Sometimes this will require some out-of-game finagling with the GM and
 other players (too many plots are written that make the party a sealed
 group with a common origin or the only ones in the world who can accomplish
 the overarching campaign goal), but it beats making yourself and everybody
 else miserable with your square peg in the round hole character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Stick to genre and tone Science fiction can cover a vast variety of themes
 and settings, so it's necessary for any specific campaign to make certain
 assumptions as to what the game is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

about
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and what sort of things it's appropriate to do and what things aren't,
 and what characters fit the setting and what don't.
 Don't push the boundaries, at least until you're used to playing in that
 setting and with that group.
 Yeah, fine, a enemy who's just pretending to be a hero until he can betray
 the team might be a cool idea, but save it for when you're sure you can
 carry it off without wrecking what everybody else is hoping to get out
 of the game.
 Similarly for a hero who would just as soon execute the hostages himself
 to prevent them from turning into undead when it's established that in
 this campaign heroes almost always manage to save the victims before they
 are irrevocably harmed.
 It can be amusing for everyone if your hero sometimes 
\shape italic
grumbles
\shape default
 about taking a harder stance...but if you just start decapitating the hostages
 over the protests of the other players, you've crossed the line.

\begin_layout Description
Play the system appropriately Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}

is designed to promote a certain style of play, which gives a large amount
 of freedom to the players to help define game-world reality; this can be
 difficult to get used to at first if you're accustomed to just announcing
 your bonuses and rolling the dice, or searching for the tiniest ambiguity
 to turn into a tactical advantage.
 Contribute to the game in the spirit that everybody else is playing, even
 if it's not your preferred style.
 If you have a real problem with the style that everybody else is enjoying
 you can bring it up for discussion, but maybe you should be playing a different
 game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Don't hog the spotlight, but don't shun it either.
 The only real limitation in the game is not how powerful or effective the
 characters are, but how much time they get to strut their stuff and be
 the center of attention.
 That's the real currency of the game: how much time do you get to show
 your character doing her stuff.
 If you suck up all the available time, that's bad, but it's also bad if
 your sole contribution to the group's enjoyment is getting your turn out
 of the way as expediently as possible, whether out of shyness or boredom.
 If you're not doing anything more than saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I attack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 every time somebody points out it's your turn, you're not contributing
 as much to the entertainment as you could be.
 If you feel like your character is ending up with too much 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spotlight
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 time, you can often share the spotlight with other characters by engaging
 them in-character--particularly if you know something about their Complications.
 If you're feeling starved for attention to your character's doings, make
 sure that you offer the GM good character and plot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hooks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 through your Complications...and remember that in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you can change your Complications if you wish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Discuss your preferences with the other players If your preferences aren't
 being met, discuss that with the other players.
 Be open about what you want, they're there to entertain you as much as
 you're there to entertain them, but don't try to unilaterally change things
 more to your liking.
 If you want more combat you can tell the other players that, or you can
 have your character grouse about inaction and lust for battle, but don't
 just have him attack when they're trying to negotiate to force their hand.
 If you can't come to an accommodation, you can't play their way or come
 up with a character that you'll have a good time playing and they can't
 enjoy your preferred style, then find a game that will satisfy you, don't
 subvert theirs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, most of this advice boils down to a principle of courtesy.
 Keep in mind that everybody at the table shares the responsibility of making
 the game fun and entertaining for everybody involved.
 Be willing to make sacrifices as far as what would be your ideal ultimate
 solo gaming experience in order to keep everybody involved and having a
 good time.
 Be flexible in what and how you play, and don't play if you're not having
 fun.

 E.g.
 A Biblical Scope character would regard a section of a city such as the
 Foreign Quarter or the Acropolis as being within Combat Range, with the
 entire City as being Pursuit Range.
 A Mythic being would regard an entire country as being within Combat Range,
 something at the far end of the world as Pursuit Range, and anything beyond
 that as Lost Contact.

Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rule-of-thumb for equipment costs is that the cost is 2 for d4, +1 per
 die-size, +1 per any Advantage without a balancing Disadvantage.
 Scope is relative to the Personal Scope for the campaign.
 E.g.
 at City Scope, Hardcase Armor is d6 vs.
 City Scope weapons, and would be scaled up or down vs.
 lower or higher Scopes.
 Similarly weapons, comm gear and the like all operate on a commensurate
 scale: a Vibro Knife at City Scope might well be able to slice through
 an ordinary automobile, while at Street scope it's a danger to pedestrians
 but not vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Costs are listed in WP, that is they are orders of magnitude: something
 that has a Cost of 2 has a price in the tens of monetary units (credits,
 double-dollars, quatloos, what-have-you); a cost of 3 would be in the hundreds,
 and 4 would be in the thousands.
 Items that might Cost 1 aren't listed; they are free for practical purposes
 under most circumstances.
 Exact prices of items are assumed to vary according to quality and local
 circumstances; some might not even be available in a setting.

\begin_layout Standard
If you need to know the exact price of an item (for instance, you're not
 using the optional Wealth rules), then roll a 1d6+1d4 (adding them together)
 for the first digit, and 1d10 for each successive digit until you've either
 accounted for them all or reached a point where you're willing to round.
 The result is the cost on the local market.
 E.g.
 a Cost 4 Chamelion Suit rolls a 3 on a d6 plus a 2 on a d4, for a total
 of 5 in the 1,000's place, then a 6, 2, and 3 for a total of 5,623 credits.

\begin_layout Subsection
Variations in Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should assume that there is wide variation in the items listed, even
 if its not reflected in a mechanical difference between the items.
 These differences should become fodder for the Primary Rule in play.
 For example, mechanically all primitive armor is just a d4 vs.
 muscle-powered weapons, but that doesn't mean that in play you should treat
 plate armor and a leather jacket as being identical; you are strongly encourage
d to decide on the fly that, say, according to the Primary Rule and the
 tone of the campaign swimming underwater in plate is forbidden, but a dagger
 has no chance of even Hindering somebody clad in plate except under special
 circumstances such as in combination with an attack that immobilizes the
 wearer.
