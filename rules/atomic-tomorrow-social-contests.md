# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## SOCIAL CONTESTS

In the retro-future world of Atomic Tomorrow, fast talking, seduction, and persuasion are skills as valuable as marksmanship or piloting. This system provides guidelines for handling social interactions as meaningful contests without undermining player agency.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Social Skills Are Not Mind Control**: Even critical successes cannot force others to act against their core values or self-interest
2. **Preserve Agency**: Player characters always retain the right to determine their own actions
3. **Reward Roleplay**: Going along with social influence (even when disadvantageous) enriches the story
4. **Consequences Matter**: Social skills create believable reactions based on the context and relationship

## TYPES OF SOCIAL CONTESTS

### Persuasion
*Convincing someone that a course of action is logical, moral, or beneficial*
- Uses CHARM vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes you are sincere and your argument has merit
- Doesn't override strong ethical objections or survival instincts

### Deception
*Convincing someone to believe something that isn't true*
- Uses GUILE vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes your falsehood
- Extreme claims still receive appropriate skepticism even on success

### Intimidation
*Frightening someone into compliance*
- Uses BRAWN (physical) or NERVE (psychological) vs. GRIT
- Success means the target feels genuinely threatened
- Temporary compliance only; may create resentment and future retaliation

### Seduction
*Appealing to someone's attraction or desire*
- Uses CHARM vs. CHARM
- Success means the target finds you genuinely appealing
- Doesn't override professional ethics, loyalty, or self-preservation

## DETERMINING OUTCOMES

### For NPCs
When a player character succeeds at a social skill against an NPC:

**Ordinary Success**:
- NPC is influenced but needs strong reasoning
- May require additional incentives
- Will not act against strong values or interests

**Special Success**:
- NPC is meaningfully influenced
- Will consider proposals favorably
- Requires minimal additional incentive
- Still won't act against core values

**Critical Success**:
- NPC is strongly influenced
- Will go out of their way to help (within reason)
- Might bend minor rules or policies
- Still preserves core values and self-interest

### For Player Characters
When an NPC (or another PC) succeeds at a social skill against a player character:

**The GM should**:
- Describe how convincing, intimidating, or charming the attempt seems
- Outline any observable facts that support the social attempt
- Note any inconsistencies the character might detect

**The player retains the right to**:
- Decide their character's ultimate response
- Consider their character's personality and values
- Determine how much they're influenced

## EXPERIENCE REWARD

*"Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment."*

When a player goes along with a successful social attempt that leads their character to make suboptimal choices:

- The character automatically receives a skill advancement check for that adventure
- This represents learning from mistakes and developing better judgment
- The advancement works according to the standard skill advancement rules

This reward applies when:
- The character takes actions they wouldn't normally take
- These actions create additional complications or challenges
- The player embraces these complications for storytelling purposes

## SOCIAL CONTESTS BETWEEN PLAYERS

When one player character attempts to influence another:

1. The initiating player rolls their relevant social skill
2. The target player rolls their relevant resistance attribute
3. The GM describes the quality of the attempt
4. **The target player decides their own response**
5. If they choose to go along with something disadvantageous to them, they receive the experience reward

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Social contests are heavily influenced by context:

### Favorable Circumstances (+20%)
- Using leverage the target cares about
- Offering something the target genuinely needs
- Having reputation or credentials relevant to the request
- Previous positive relationship with the target

### Unfavorable Circumstances (-20%)
- Target has prior negative experience with you
- Request clearly conflicts with target's interests
- Significant status difference (when attempting to influence superiors)
- Target is suspicious or on guard

## EXAMPLE: PERSUADING THE CAPTAIN

**Scenario**: Lieutenant Rodriguez wants to convince Captain Harris to delay the mission departure to investigate an anomalous signal.

**Lieutenant**: "I'd like to use my Persuasion skill to convince the captain this signal deserves investigation."

**GM**: "The captain's on a tight schedule from Space Command. Roll your Persuasion."

*Lieutenant rolls 25 on Persuasion (70%) - a special success*

**GM**: "Captain Harris listens intently to your explanation. He seems convinced by your technical analysis and the potential significance of the signal. However, he remains concerned about mission parameters. He's inclined to give you some time, but needs to know exactly how long and what resources you'll need."

*The GM is conveying that the persuasion was very effective, but the captain still has legitimate concerns and constraints*

## EXAMPLE: DECEPTION BETWEEN PLAYERS

**Scenario**: Dr. Chen (PC) lies to Security Chief Williams (PC) about unauthorized experiments.

**Dr. Chen**: "I'll try to convince Williams that my late-night lab access was authorized. I'll use my Deception skill."

**GM**: "Go ahead and roll."

*Dr. Chen rolls 42 on Deception (65%) - an ordinary success*

**GM to Williams**: "Dr. Chen's explanation seems plausible. The paperwork he shows you appears to be in order, though you notice it lacks the usual administrative timestamp. His demeanor seems mostly calm, but you detect slight nervousness."

*The GM provides all relevant information, leaving the final judgment to Williams' player*

**Williams' Player**: "I'm suspicious, but I don't have enough evidence to call him out directly. I'll pretend to accept his explanation but flag his lab for additional monitoring."

**GM**: "That's a reasonable response given the information you have."

## LONG-TERM INFLUENCE

Social contests aren't just for immediate results. Successful social interactions can:

1. **Build Reputation**: Making honest persuasion attempts builds credibility for future interactions
2. **Create Relationships**: Successful social contests can begin long-term connections with NPCs
3. **Establish Patterns**: Regularly deceiving someone eventually leads to suspicion
4. **Yield Information**: Even failed attempts can reveal what someone values or fears

## FINAL NOTE

In Atomic Tomorrow Adventures, social skills represent genuine expertise in understanding and influencing people. They're as valuable as technical skills in many situations, but they're not supernatural abilities. The best outcomes come when players embrace both the successes and failures of social contests as opportunities for character development and storytelling.
