# ARTIFACT RESEARCH SYSTEM

## CONCEPT

When faced with alien artifacts or creating experimental devices, characters embark on a research journey that combines different approaches. Success requires teamwork, adaptability, and resource management as researchers navigate unexpected challenges and breakthroughs.

## RESOLUTION MECHANIC

Research follows the core Atomic Tomorrow d100 system:

* **Ordinary Success** : Contributes 1 Research Point
* **Special Success** (roll ending in 0 or 5): Contributes 2 Research Points
* **Critical Success** (doubles under skill): Contributes 3 Research Points
* **Special Failure** (roll ending in 0 or 5 over skill): Causes a research tangent
* **Critical Failure** (doubles over skill): Major setback, lose progress on current node

## RESEARCH APPROACHES

* ♥️ **HEARTS: INTUITIVE/PSI APPROACH**
  * Skills: Psi abilities, NERVE checks, Perception (Intuition)
  * Resource: Atomic Power Cells (used to amplify psionic impressions)
* ♦️ **DIAMONDS: SCIENTIFIC APPROACH**
  * Skills: Science specializations, Investigation (Analysis), Computer Systems
  * Resource: Reference Materials (scientific journals, technical manuals, historical data)
* ♣️ **CLUBS: TECHNICAL/ENGINEERING APPROACH**
  * Skills: Engineering, Technology, Repair
  * Resource: Spare Components (circuit elements, mechanical parts, raw materials)
* ♠️ **SPADES: XENOLOGY/CULTURAL APPROACH**
  * Skills: Xenology, Academics (Ancient Languages), Social (Cultural Sensitivity)
  * Resource: Cultural Artifacts (comparison specimens, xenological databases)

* ## Core Mechanics

  ### Setup
  - Standard 52-card deck
  - Four research approaches (suits): Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades
  - Each suit represents a different research methodology
  - Resource types correspond to suits for acceleration

  ### Basic Flow

  1. **Initial Draw**: GM draws cards until one matches the current research approach (suit)
  2. **Hidden Track Creation**: Non-matching cards are placed face-down in separate rows by suit
  3. **Player Choice**: Player decides between:
     - Working on the revealed matching card
     - Exploring a hidden track (committing to that suit until completion)
  4. **Track Commitment**: When choosing a hidden track, GM flips the top card face-up
  5. **Completion**: Research continues until threshold is met **and** an Ace is drawn
  6. **Cleanup**: Unused face-down cards go to bottom of deck

  ### Difficulty Thresholds

  Research projects have announced minimum card values required before an Ace can complete the research:

  - **Routine (3-4)**: Basic research, almost guaranteed success
  - **Moderate (5-6)**: Standard difficulty, likely but not certain success  
  - **Hard (7-8)**: Challenging research, real risk of hitting Ace first
  - **Extreme (9-10)**: Cutting-edge research, Ace quite possible before threshold

  ### Special Cards

  - **Ace**: Completes research if threshold has been met; forces continuation if not
  - **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Special events or complications (GM discretion)
  - **Number Cards**: Progress toward threshold, with suit-specific resource spending for acceleration

  ### Resource Acceleration

  Players can spend suit-appropriate resources to complete cards faster:
  - **Hearts**: Time, patience, careful observation
  - **Diamonds**: Money, equipment, materials
  - **Clubs**: Connections, favors, social resources
  - **Spades**: Risk-taking, direct action, bold moves

## RESOURCES AND THEIR USES

### Atomic Batteries (Hearts)

* **In-world representation** : Small, glowing blue cylinders that provide concentrated energy
* **Research application** : Power experimental equipment, amplify psionic impressions
* **Acquisition** : Found in laboratories, purchased from technology suppliers
* **Risk** : Using multiple cells increases chance of energy discharge (roll NERVE or suffer temporary ill effects)

### Reference Materials (Diamonds)

* **In-world representation** : Crystal data storage, rare technical journals, historical references
* **Research application** : Compare findings against established knowledge
* **Acquisition** : Libraries, academic contacts, Rhine Institute archives
* **Limitation** : Some references may be classified or restricted

### Spare Components (Clubs)

* **In-world representation** : Circuit elements, mechanical parts, rare materials
* **Research application** : Build test equipment, replace damaged sections
* **Acquisition** : Salvage, markets, engineering supplies
* **Limitation** : Some components are consumed during use

### Cultural Artifacts (Spades)

* **In-world representation** : Comparison specimens, alien writing samples
* **Research application** : Context for understanding unknown symbols or functions
* **Acquisition** : Museums, private collections, field research
* **Complication** : Some artifacts may have unexpected properties

## EXAMPLE LABORATORY SCENE

> The team gathers in Dr. Chen's laboratory at New Athens Academy. Holographic projections of the artifact float above the central table, rotating slowly to reveal intricate surface patterns. Laboratory equipment hums in the background, casting atomic-blue light across the researchers' faces.
>
> "I believe we should begin with a technical assessment," says the roboticist, placing a Club card at the center of the table. "If we can understand its physical structure, the function might become clear."
>
> The GM reveals a 7 of Clubs, indicating the challenge will require 7 Research Points.
>
> "I'll start by examining the internal components," the roboticist continues, rolling against Engineering (Robotics). The dice show 43 against a skill of 75% – an ordinary success adding 1 Research Point.
>
> The team's boy genius follows, "Let me scan it with my prototype analyzer." He rolls against Technology (Diagnostics), scoring 35 – another success for 1 more Research Point.
>
> "We'll need to work faster," says the diplomat, reaching into her case. "I've brought some rare atomic switching elements from the Mercury research outpost. They might help us build testing apparatus." She contributes 2 Spare Components, reducing the remaining requirement from 5 to 3 Points.
>
> As research continues, the telekinetic notices something unusual and decides to approach the artifact intuitively. Unfortunately, his NERVE check results in 85 – a special failure (ending in 5) that sends the research in an unexpected direction. The GM draws a random card: the Jack of Hearts.
>
> "As you attempt to sense the artifact's purpose," the GM explains, "it suddenly emits a pulse of energy that interferes with your psionic abilities. The research takes an unexpected turn as you discover it responds to mental patterns..."

## SPECIAL CARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS

When a special card comes up, or the research is forced onto a tangent, the GM should ground what's happening in terms of the world, not just the mechanics.  E.g. if a researcher has rolled a special failure and the research now has to focus on clubs (engineering approach) instead of purely scientific (diamonds), you might say "Unfortunately that seems to be all that your experiments can discern at the moment, you'll need greater access to the interior of the device to proceed" or if it's now spades (xenological/cultural): "Suddenly a series off flashing alien symbols light up on the front panel, judging by their color and strobing it's probably not safe to continue without figuring out what they're trying to indicate."

### Face Cards (Challenges & Opportunities)

 **Jacks (Unexpected Complications)** :

* ♥️ Heart Jack: Psionic Feedback - requires NERVE check or suffer disorienting hallucinations
* ♦️ Diamond Jack: Contradictory Data - previous research points partially invalidated
* ♣️ Club Jack: Component Failure - testing equipment damaged, repair required
* ♠️ Spade Jack: Translation Error - cultural misinterpretation creates false conclusion

 **Queens (Research Crossroads)** :

* ♥️ Heart Queen: Intuitive Insight - reveals hidden aspect but risks researcher's wellbeing
* ♦️ Diamond Queen: Scientific Breakthrough - reduces any future card value by 2
* ♣️ Club Queen: Technical Stabilization - provides immunity to next complication
* ♠️ Spade Queen: Cultural Revelation - potentially dangerous cultural significance discovered

 **Kings (Major Developments)** :

* ♥️ Heart King: Psionic Connection - establish direct "communication" with artifact
* ♦️ Diamond King: Theoretical Framework - draw 3 cards, choose 1 to pursue
* ♣️ Club King: Engineering Solution - automatically complete current node
* ♠️ Spade King: Ancient Security Protocol - triggers defensive mechanism

### Aces & Jokers

* **Aces** : Represent major breakthroughs (success nodes)
* **Jokers** :
  * **Red Joker**: Extraordinary Breakthrough - skip directly to nearest Ace
  * **Black Joker**: Catastrophic Failure - research collapses, return to start with penalty

## RESOURCE ACQUISITION MECHANICS

### Purchasing Resources

* Standard resources available at listed prices in appropriate locations
* Availability decreases in remote or specialized locations:
  * Major Cities: All tiers available
  * Colonies: Basic and some specialized resources
  * Outposts: Only basic resources, if any

### Crafting Resources

Characters with appropriate skills can craft temporary substitutes:

* **Engineering (Experimental)** : Create Spare Components (1 day per tier)
* **Science (Physics)** : Charge Atomic Energy Crystals (6 hours per tier)
* **Psi (Energy Manipulation)** : Attune Psi Focus Crystals (4 hours per tier)
* **Success Level Effects** :
* Ordinary Success: Resource functions at chosen tier but degrades after use
* Special Success: Resource functions normally at chosen tier
* Critical Success: Resource functions as if one tier higher

### Salvaging Resources

Characters can salvage resources from appropriate sources:

* **Repair (Salvage)** : Extract components from broken equipment
* **Science (Laboratory Techniques)** : Recover energy from depleted crystals
* **Investigation (Archaeology)** : Recover cultural artifacts from ruins
* **Difficulty** : -20% for Tier 2 resources, -40% for Tier 3 resources

## RESOURCE APPLICATIONS IN RESEARCH

### Standard Application

* Each resource point spent reduces the required Research Points by 1, spending points is voluntary
* Multiple resources can be combined up to the value of the card
* Resources must match the suit being researched

### Advanced Applications

* **Mixed Resources** : With a successful Science (Interdisciplinary) check, resources from different suits can be combined at 75% efficiency
* **Overcharging** : Apply double the normal resource points with a successful Engineering check, but risk equipment damage
* **Resource Preservation** : A successful Technology (Efficiency) check preserves resources for reuse at 50% effectiveness

## EXAMPLE: RESOURCE APPLICATIONS

> The team faces a challenging 8 of Clubs node, requiring significant Technical research.
>
> "I've got basic components worth 1 research point," says the roboticist, "but we'll need more."
>
> "The university provided these specialized parts," the boy genius adds, producing a box of precision-engineered components worth 2 points.
>
> "And I managed to acquire this," the diplomat reveals, placing an experimental vacuum tube assembly on the table. "It's military prototype technology - 3 research points."
>
> "That's 6 points total," calculates the Solar Ranger. "We only need to earn 2 more through skill checks."
>
> "I could try to optimize our resource use," suggests the roboticist. "With a good Technology roll, we might preserve some components for future research." He attempts the check, succeeding with a roll of 32 against his 70% skill.
>
> "Your careful approach means the specialized parts aren't consumed," the GM decides. "You can reuse them at half effectiveness (1 point) on a future Clubs challenge."
