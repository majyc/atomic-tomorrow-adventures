## **WELCOME TO THE ATOMIC AGE**

Welcome to the far-flung gleaming atomic future of 2025! Humanity has spread across the solar system in gleaming rocket ships powered by atomic fire. Mars hosts bustling colonies beneath its red skies, Venus conceals ancient secrets in its steaming jungles, O'Neill cylinders hang in space at Earth's L5 point, the asteroid belt thrums with prospectors seeking their fortunes in the depths of space, and rumors swirl of a Forerunner megastructure discovered encircling Jupiter. This is the golden age of space exploration, where ray guns gleam, robots serve, and adventure waits beyond every planet's horizon.

You're explorers, adventurers, and heroes of this atomic tomorrow: rocket jockeys with nerves of steel, brilliant scientists with revolutionary theories, swashbuckling scouts who blaze trails across alien worlds, daring explorers, suave diplomats, and countless other extraordinary individuals. The solar system needs people with grit, determination, curiosity and the courage to face whatever mysteries lurk in the dark between the worlds.

Whether you're hunting for ancient Martian artifacts, defending a Titan colony from undersea predators, negotiating peace between Venus' squabbling tribes of autochthons, or racing to deliver vital medical supplies to Hospital Station on its endless transit between Venus and Mars, your adventures will shape the future of humanity among the planets. Fame, Fortune, Knowledge, Adventure, they are all yours for the taking, if you dare!

## **CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION**

*Building heroes worthy of the atomic tomorrow*

Creating a character for Atomic Tomorrow Adventures means crafting someone extraordinary enough to stand among the planets and far-flung outposts of the Solar System yet human enough to care about what happens to the people they encounter among those distant worlds. You're building explorers who look at the vast darkness between planets and see possibility rather than emptiness, scientists whose curiosity drives them to unlock mysteries that could reshape human understanding, and heroes whose courage makes them willing to risk everything for the sake of discovery and adventure.

The character creation system uses four essential questions to define who your character is: What makes you extraordinary? What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? How were you raised? Answer these questions by selecting one option from each of four columns, and you'll have a complete character concept that's both mechanically functional and dramatically interesting.

### **THE FOUR-COLUMN APPROACH**

Think of character creation as building a sentence that tells us everything essential about your character. "I'm a **Brilliant Xenobiologist** from **Venus** with an **Academic Training** background" immediately gives us a clear picture of someone whose exceptional intellect led them to study alien life forms, whose origins on humanity's most mysterious world shaped their perspective, and whose formal education provided them with the scientific foundation to excel in their field.

Each column serves a different purpose in defining your character:

**Column A: Epithet** - What makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people? This is the quality that sets you apart from the millions of normal folks living their routine lives across the solar system. Whether you're Brilliant, Lucky, Two-Fisted, or Daring, your epithet represents the spark of greatness that makes you the protagonist of adventures rather than just another face in the crowd.

**Column B: Profession** - What you do for a living and what shaped your skills. Your profession represents years of training, experience, and expertise that have molded you into someone capable of handling the challenges that ordinary citizens couldn't even attempt. Whether you're a Rocket Jockey racing between worlds, a Scout mapping uncharted territories, or a Xenobiologist studying impossible life forms, your profession gives you the tools to succeed where others would fail.

**Column C: Origin** - Where you're from shapes more than just your accent. Growing up on Mars means dealing with thin air and ancient mysteries. Being raised on Luna means your bones adapted to low gravity and your mind adapted to life in humanity's first real space colony. Venusians understand steaming jungles and impossible atmospheric pressures. Each origin provides physical adaptations, cultural knowledge, and a unique perspective on what it means to be human in the atomic age.

**Column D: Background** - How you were raised and what experiences shaped you before you became an adventurer. Were you raised in a Military Family that taught you discipline and tactical thinking? Did Academic Training give you the intellectual tools to understand complex problems? Perhaps a Frontier Homestead background taught you self-reliance and practical skills. Your background provides the foundation upon which your professional training was built.

### **GENERATING YOUR ATTRIBUTES**

Your character's basic capabilities are represented by seven attributes that measure different aspects of physical and mental prowess. These attributes form the foundation for everything your character attempts, from piloting spacecraft through asteroid fields to negotiating with alien ambassadors.

**BRAWN** represents physical strength, toughness, and athletic power. High Brawn helps you swing that wrench with enough force to fix a stuck valve, survive the crushing acceleration of emergency maneuvers, or simply intimidate opponents with your physical presence.

**REFLEX** covers physical coordination, dexterity, and reaction speed. Whether you're dodging ray gun blasts, flying a nimble fighter through a debris field, or performing delicate surgery with alien anatomy, Reflex determines how well your body responds to your will.

**NERVE** measures mental composure and courage under pressure. When the alien artifact starts glowing with unknown energy, when the ship's hull begins buckling under atmospheric pressure, or when you're face-to-face with something that shouldn't exist, Nerve determines whether you keep your cool and act rationally.

**SAVVY** represents intelligence, technical knowledge, and perception. This is your ability to understand how things work, notice important details, and make the mental connections that lead to breakthrough discoveries. High Savvy lets you jury-rig solutions to impossible problems and see patterns that others miss.

**CHARM** covers charisma, leadership, and persuasiveness. In an age where humanity is expanding across the solar system and making contact with alien intelligence, the ability to communicate effectively, inspire others, and represent humanity well becomes critically important.

**GRIT** measures endurance, willpower, and mental fortitude. Space travel is hard. Exploration is dangerous. Discovery often requires pushing through discomfort, fear, and exhaustion to reach the other side. Grit is what keeps you going when lesser individuals would give up.

**GUILE** represents cunning, deception, and craftiness. Sometimes the direct approach won't work. Sometimes you need to be clever rather than brave, subtle rather than forceful. Guile helps you find alternative solutions when conventional approaches fail, and helps you spot duplicity in others.

Most humans have attributes ranging from 3 to 18, with 10-11 representing average capability. However, your origin significantly affects how these attributes are generated:

**Terrans** (Earth-born humans) must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, distributed among the seven attributes as you choose. Generations of genetic optimization and technological enhancement have made Earth-born humans remarkably standardized in their capabilities, though you can still choose where to place these values to reflect your character's particular strengths and weaknesses.

**Terran Exiles** represent Earth-born humans who left their home-world under unusual circumstances. They may choose to use either the Standard Array or roll attributes like other origins, representing either their standardized Earth heritage or the extraordinary circumstances that led to their exile.

**All other origins** roll 2d10 for each attribute and arrange the results as desired, with results below 3 becoming 3 and above 18 becoming 18. Growing up in the challenging environments of space and other worlds creates more variable human development, sometimes producing individuals with capabilities that exceed normal human ranges.

Remember that your Origin and Background selections will modify these base attributes, so you can achieve values outside the normal 3-18 range through the experiences that shaped your character's development.

### **COLUMN A: EPITHET**

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. It provides special abilities and unique dice roll interpretations that other characters don't possess.

## **CHAPTER 2: CORE SYSTEMS**

*The fundamental mechanics of atomic age adventure*

The atomic age runs on a simple principle: extraordinary people can achieve extraordinary things through skill, determination, and a willingness to risk everything for the sake of discovery. These core systems provide the mechanical foundation for adventures that feel both scientifically plausible and dramatically exciting, where success comes from character competence rather than random chance.

### **THE BASIC RESOLUTION SYSTEM**

When your character attempts something with uncertain outcome and meaningful consequences, roll percentile dice (two ten-sided dice, treating one as tens and the other as ones) against your skill percentage. Rolling equal to or under your skill percentage means success; rolling over means failure. Higher skill percentages represent greater competence—a Rocket Jockey with Piloting (Spacecraft) at 70% succeeds more often than a novice with the same skill at 30%.

The quality of your success matters as much as simply succeeding or failing. The atomic age rewards exceptional performance and punishes sloppy work:

**Ordinary Success** occurs when you roll under your skill percentage with a normal result. You achieve what you set out to do competently and efficiently.

**Special Success** happens when you roll your skill percentage or under with a result ending in 0 or 5. You achieve your goal with particular excellence, creating additional benefits or avoiding potential complications.

**Critical Success** occurs when you roll doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.) less than or equal to your skill percentage. You achieve your goal brilliantly, creating significant additional benefits and demonstrating true mastery.

**Ordinary Failure** occurs when you roll over your skill percentage.

**Special Failure** occurs when you roll over your skill percentage with a result ending in 0 or 5.  Not only do you not achieve your goal, but some mishap may have occurred costing you some of your hard-won progress.

**Critical Failure** occurs when you roll doubles (66, 77, 88, etc.) You fail hard, a piece of equipment breaks, or you lose all your progress in completing the task.

**Automatic Success** happens on rolls of 01-05 regardless of skill level, representing those moments when everything comes together perfectly despite the odds.

**Automatic Failure** occurs on rolls of 96-00 regardless of skill level, representing catastrophic errors that can happen even to experts under pressure.

### **TASK DIFFICULTY AND MODIFIERS**

The atomic age presents challenges that range from routine operations to tasks that push the boundaries of human capability. Rather than changing target numbers, the system modifies your effective skill percentage based on circumstances:

**Routine conditions** (+0%) represent standard operating conditions with proper equipment and adequate time. This is your baseline skill percentage.

**Easy conditions** (+20%) occur when you have favorable circumstances, excellent equipment, or plenty of time to work carefully.

**Challenging conditions** (-20%) arise from time pressure, improvised tools, or unfavorable circumstances that make success more difficult.

**Difficult conditions** (-40%) represent severe complications like working under fire, using completely inappropriate tools, or dealing with hostile environments.

**Extreme conditions** (-60%) occur when attempting tasks under nearly impossible circumstances with critically limited resources.

**Heroic conditions** (-80%) represent the stuff of legends—tasks that ordinary people simply cannot attempt and even heroes accomplish only through extraordinary effort.

Apply only the single most significant modifier rather than stacking multiple penalties. The atomic age challenges heroes with dramatic obstacles, not arithmetic complexity.

### **EXTENDED TASKS AND TEAMWORK**

Some challenges require sustained effort or the coordinated work of multiple characters. Extended tasks use a success-counting system where different qualities of success contribute different amounts toward completion:

**Standard Tasks** require 1 success and represent things like hot-wiring a vehicle or treating a minor injury.

**Complex Tasks** require 3 successes and cover challenges like bypassing security systems or performing field surgery.

**Demanding Tasks** require 5 successes for things like deciphering alien code or repairing damaged spacecraft.

**Expert Tasks** require 8 successes for challenges like reconstructing ancient technology or navigating treacherous asteroid fields.

**Master Tasks** require 12 or more successes for achievements like terraforming regions or developing revolutionary technologies.

**Ordinary Success** contributes 1 point toward completion, **Special Success** contributes 2 points, and **Critical Success** contributes 3 points. This rewards exceptional performance while ensuring that even ordinary competence makes meaningful progress.

When multiple characters work together, they can contribute as primary operators (making normal rolls) or assistants (rolling at -20% but contributing a maximum of 1 success regardless of quality). This represents the reality that complex tasks benefit from help, but only to a point. The Game Master will decide which is appropriate based on the task at hand.

### **COMBAT FUNDAMENTALS**

When violence erupts in the atomic age, it happens quickly and decisively. Combat uses the same basic resolution system as other challenges, but with special attention to the dramatic pacing that makes conflicts exciting rather than tedious.

**Initiative** determines turn order through REFLEX checks at the start of each encounter. Success quality affects when you act, with critical success allowing you to act first regardless of other results.

**Actions** are limited to what you can reasonably accomplish in six seconds. Each character gets one major action (attack, complex skill use), one movement (change position, mount/dismount), and one minor action (draw weapon, flip switch, brief communication).

**Attacks** use appropriate combat skills against target numbers modified by range, cover, and movement. Success inflicts wounds based on weapon type, with special and critical successes causing additional damage.

**Defense** allows one free defensive reaction per round (Parry, Block, Dodge), with additional defenses suffering cumulative -20% penalties. Some epithets and specializations provide additional defensive options.

**Wounds** accumulate until characters become incapacitated (at 4 wounds) or dying (at 5 wounds). The first three wounds cause no mechanical penalties until after combat is completed, reflecting the cinematic resilience of atomic age heroes.

### **ADVANCEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT**

Characters improve through experience and training rather than arbitrary advancement schedules. When you achieve a critical success with a skill during an adventure, you have the opportunity to improve that skill through practice and reflection.  Mark that skill for an advancement check later.

After the adventure, for each skill that qualified for an advancement check roll percentile dice against your current skill percentage. If you roll higher than your current percentage, the skill improves!


* **Beginner (<50%)**: improve by 10%
* **Skilled (50-69%)**: improve by 3%
* **Expert (70-89%)**: improve by 2%
* **Master (90%+)**: improve by 1 %

Higher skill levels improve more slowly, representing the increased difficulty of mastering advanced techniques.

This system rewards characters for attempting challenging tasks and achieving exceptional results, encouraging players to take risks and push their characters toward greater competence.

### **ATOMIC AGE TECHNOLOGY**

The technology of 2025 combines atomic power with retrofuturistic aesthetics to create equipment that's both scientifically advanced and dramatically appropriate. Atomic engines provide virtually unlimited power for spacecraft and installations. Ray guns deliver precise energy discharges that can stun or kill depending on setting. Robots with positronic brains handle routine tasks while maintaining the Three Laws of Robotics that prevent them from harming humans.

Technology in the atomic age is reliable and understandable rather than mysterious or unpredictable. Equipment failures occur due to damage, misuse, or exceptional circumstances rather than random breakdowns. This keeps the focus on character actions and decisions rather than equipment maintenance.  

Equipment in the atomic age is built with the three R's always in mind: Reliability, Redundancy, and Reparability.   When you're a million miles from the nearest repair shop, lives depend on your being able to fix whatever goes wrong on the ship with materials at hand.  Rocket ships carry extensive stores with replacements and are always equipped with at least rudimentary machine shops; larger and better equipped ships may have an entire deck devoted to this, but even a one-man scout will stock what it needs for repairs in the great beyond.  Equipment will almost always be analog, or at least have an analog mechanical back-up.  Digital screens, tablets, and heavily computerized are too prone to failure during solar storms that frequently short out electrical systems.  In space the blue screen of death would be exactly that!  All hatches and airlocks will have a back-up hand-cranks, all elevator shafts will have access panels and ladders, all corridors will have luminescent strips and markings that require no power to operate.

### **ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**

The atomic age presents environmental challenges that test character capability and equipment functionality. Vacuum exposure, radiation effects, extreme temperatures, and toxic atmospheres require appropriate protection and careful planning.

**Vacuum** causes immediate problems for unprotected characters, requiring pressure suits and life support systems for any extended exposure.

**Radiation** creates both immediate and long-term health risks, necessitating shielding and detection equipment in potentially contaminated areas.

**Atmospheric hazards** range from toxic gases to pressure differences that can be lethal without proper equipment and preparation.

**Zero gravity** affects movement and combat, requiring specialized training and equipment for effective operation.

These challenges create dramatic tension and require characters to use appropriate skills and equipment, but they don't overwhelm adventures with technical complexity.

### **SOCIAL INTERACTIONS**

The atomic age emphasizes cooperation, exploration, and the expansion of human knowledge and influence. Social interactions focus on building relationships, gathering information, and resolving conflicts through communication rather than violence.

Social skills can influence attitudes and provide information, but they cannot force actions that contradict core values or beliefs. Characters retain agency over their decisions even when subjected to persuasive arguments or emotional appeals.

Success in social situations comes from understanding motivations, finding common ground, and offering solutions that benefit all parties rather than from overwhelming opposition through superior charisma or manipulation.

### **PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**

These core systems work together to create adventures that feel both scientifically plausible and dramatically exciting. Characters succeed through competence, preparation, and teamwork rather than random chance. Challenges test character capabilities while providing opportunities for creative problem-solving and heroic action.

The atomic age rewards bold thinking, careful planning, and collaborative effort. Whether you're navigating through an asteroid field, negotiating with alien ambassadors, or unlocking the secrets of ancient technology, success comes from understanding the situation, applying appropriate skills, and working together toward common goals.

## **CHAPTER 4: BASIC RULES**

*Core mechanics for atomic age adventures*

These essential rules provide everything you need to play Atomic Tomorrow Adventures. Think of this chapter as your quick reference guide—the mechanical foundation that supports all the atomic age excitement you'll experience among the stars.

### **MAKING SKILL CHECKS**

When your character attempts something with uncertain outcome and meaningful consequences, follow these simple steps:

1. **Identify the appropriate skill** for what you're attempting
2. **Apply any circumstance modifiers** (-80% to +20% based on conditions)
3. **Roll percentile dice** (two ten-sided dice, one for tens and one for ones)
4. **Compare the result to your modified skill percentage**

**Success** means you rolled equal to or under your skill percentage. **Failure** means you rolled over your skill percentage.

**Quality matters**: Special (ending in 0 or 5) and Critical  (doubles) provide additional benefits or penalties beyond basic success/failure, depending on whether the roll itself is a success or failure.

### **ATTRIBUTE CHECKS**

When a situation calls for raw capability rather than trained skill, make an attribute check by rolling against five times your attribute score. A character with REFLEX 12 would roll against 60% for a REFLEX check.

Use attribute checks for:
- Lifting, breaking, or moving heavy objects (BRAWN)
- Reacting quickly to sudden events (REFLEX)  
- Staying calm under pressure (NERVE)
- Noticing important details (SAVVY)
- Making a good first impression (CHARM)
- Enduring hardship or pain (GRIT)
- Acting sneaky or deceptive (GUILE)

### **COMBAT BASICS**

When violence erupts, combat proceeds in structured rounds representing six seconds of action each.

**Initiative**: At the start of combat, everyone makes a REFLEX check. Highest success quality goes first, ties broken by the highest roll, or if the rolls are tied (!) by REFLEX score.  Once who goes first is settled, play proceeds around the table, with NPCs going when play comes around to the GM.  To keep it from getting stale (Bob always goes right after Alice because of where he's sitting), every other combat can reverse whether play goes clockwise or counterclockwise.

**Actions Each Round**: You can perform one major action (attack, complex skill use), one movement (change position), and one minor action (draw weapon, brief communication).

**Attacks**: Roll your combat skill against a target number modified by range, cover, and movement. Success causes wounds based on your weapon plus success quality bonuses.

**Defense**: You get one free defensive reaction per round (Parry, Block, Dodge). Additional defenses suffer cumulative -20% penalties.

**Wounds**: Characters can sustain three wounds with no penalties, become incapacitated at four wounds, and start dying at five wounds.

### **EXTENDED TASKS**

Some challenges require sustained effort or multiple successes to complete:

- **Standard Tasks**: 1 success (hot-wiring a vehicle)
- **Complex Tasks**: 3 successes (field surgery)  
- **Demanding Tasks**: 5 successes (deciphering alien code)
- **Expert Tasks**: 8 successes (major repairs)
- **Master Tasks**: 12+ successes (revolutionary breakthroughs)

Different success qualities contribute different amounts: Ordinary Success contributes 1 point, Special Success contributes 2 points, Critical Success contributes 3 points.

### **TEAMWORK**

When multiple characters work together:

**Primary Operators** make normal skill rolls and contribute full success values.

**Assistants** make skill rolls at -20% but can contribute a maximum of 1 success per roll regardless of quality.

**Leadership** can help coordinate group efforts, allowing rerolls of failed attempts based on the leader's success quality.

### **ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS**

The atomic age presents unique challenges that require preparation and appropriate equipment:

**Vacuum Exposure**: Unprotected characters take 1 wound per round and face additional complications.

**Radiation**: Requires GRIT checks at regular intervals, with failure causing both immediate and long-term effects.

**Zero Gravity**: Physical actions require Athletics (Zero-G) skill, with untrained characters suffering -40% penalties.

**Extreme Temperatures**: Require appropriate protection and regular GRIT checks to avoid injury.

### **ADVANCEMENT**

Characters improve through experience and training:

When you achieve a **Critical Success** with a skill during an adventure, you can attempt to improve that skill afterward.

Roll percentile dice against your current skill percentage. If you roll **higher** than your current percentage, increase the skill by the ones die of your improvement roll (1-9 points).

Higher skill levels improve more slowly:
- **Skilled (50-69%)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1-5
- **Expert (70-89%)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1-3  
- **Master (90%+)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1

### **ATOMIC AGE EQUIPMENT**

Technology in 2025 is reliable, powerful, and aesthetically pleasing. Equipment functions as designed unless damaged, misused, or subjected to extraordinary circumstances.

**Power Systems**: Atomic power provides virtually unlimited energy for properly maintained equipment.

**Ray Guns**: Standard sidearms with stun and lethal settings, reliable and precise.

**Vehicles**: Spacecraft and aircraft designed for specific operating environments, with performance characteristics that affect piloting difficulty.

**Robots**: Positronic-brained automatons that follow the Three Laws and can be trusted with important tasks.

### **QUICK REFERENCE MODIFIERS**

**Circumstance Modifiers**:
- Easy conditions: +20%
- Routine conditions: +0%  
- Challenging conditions: -20%
- Difficult conditions: -40%
- Extreme conditions: -60%
- Heroic conditions: -80%

**Success Quality**:
- 01-05: Automatic Success
- Doubles under skill: Critical Success (+2 bonus effects)
- Ending in 0 or 5 under skill: Special Success (+1 bonus effect)  
- Under skill: Ordinary Success
- Over skill: Failure
- 96-00: Automatic Failure

**Combat Modifiers**:
- Point Blank (0-2m): +20%
- Close Range (3-10m): +0%
- Medium Range (11-50m): -20%
- Long Range (51-100m): -40%
- Extreme Range (101m+): -60%

Remember: The atomic age rewards competence, preparation, and teamwork. Success comes from understanding challenges and applying appropriate skills rather than relying on luck or random chance.

## **CHAPTER 5: ADVENTURING IN THE ATOMIC AGE**

*Guidance for players on how to approach atomic age adventures*

Welcome to the atomic tomorrow, where humanity's greatest adventure has just begun. This chapter helps you understand what makes Atomic Tomorrow Adventures special and how to play your character in ways that capture the wonder, optimism, and excitement of the atomic age. Think of it as your guide to becoming a true hero of the retrofuturistic future.

### **THE ATOMIC AGE MINDSET**

The year 2025 represents humanity at its most hopeful and ambitious. This isn't a dystopian future where technology has turned against us or a gritty reality where survival is the only goal. Instead, it's the gleaming tomorrow that 1950s science fiction promised—a world where atomic energy powers cities that sparkle like jewels, where rocket ships carry explorers to worlds of wonder, and where every discovery expands human knowledge and capability.

#### **Optimism Over Cynicism**

Your character lives in an age where problems have solutions, where science and cooperation can overcome any challenge, and where the future holds infinite promise. When faced with difficulties, atomic age heroes don't despair or assume the worst—they roll up their sleeves and figure out how to make things better.

This doesn't mean ignoring danger or pretending everything is perfect. Pirates lurk in asteroid fields, alien technology poses genuine mysteries, and exploration always carries risks. But these challenges exist to be overcome through competence, courage, and teamwork rather than endured as inevitable suffering.

**In Practice**: When your character encounters a problem, ask "How can we solve this?" rather than "How bad could this get?" Look for creative solutions that use your skills and equipment. Trust your teammates and the reliability of atomic age technology.

#### **Wonder Over Mundane**

The atomic age is fundamentally about discovery and exploration. Every planet holds mysteries waiting to be unlocked. Every alien artifact might revolutionize human understanding. Every journey between worlds offers opportunities to see something that no human has ever seen before.

Your character should approach the universe with curiosity and enthusiasm rather than bored professionalism. The fact that interplanetary travel has become routine doesn't make it ordinary—it makes it an everyday miracle that still deserves appreciation.

**In Practice**: Take time to notice and comment on the amazing things your character experiences. The gleaming spires of Luna City, the red horizons of Mars, the impossible creatures of Venus—these aren't just background details, they're wonders that should inspire awe and excitement.

#### **Cooperation Over Competition**

The atomic age emphasizes teamwork and mutual aid over cutthroat competition. Humanity's expansion across the solar system requires people working together toward common goals. While personal ambition and professional rivalry certainly exist, they operate within a framework of shared human purpose.

Your character should look for ways to help others succeed rather than seeking victory at others' expense. The vast scale of space exploration means there's room for everyone to achieve their goals, and today's rival might be tomorrow's rescue party when things go wrong in the depths of space.

**In Practice**: Support other characters' plans and ideas. Share resources and information freely. Look for win-win solutions to conflicts. Remember that in the atomic age, everyone benefits when humanity expands its knowledge and influence.

### **PLAYING YOUR EPITHET**

Your epithet isn't just a collection of mechanical bonuses—it's the foundation of your character's personality and approach to challenges. Understanding how to embody your epithet will make your character more engaging and help you contribute to adventures in distinctive ways.

#### **Tough Epithets in Action**

If you're **Grizzled**, **Hard-Bitten**, or **Battle-Scarred**, you've been shaped by difficult experiences that taught you how to endure when others would break. You don't flinch from danger, and your steady presence reassures teammates in crisis situations.

**Roleplay Focus**: Be the rock that others lean on. Share stories of past adventures (without dominating conversations). Volunteer for dangerous tasks that others might hesitate to attempt. Show concern for teammates' welfare based on your hard-won experience.

**Example**: When the team faces a dangerous climb down a crater wall, your Battle-Scarred character doesn't just make the Athletics check—they tie off safety lines for everyone, share techniques learned from similar situations, and keep everyone's spirits up with matter-of-fact confidence.

#### **Skilled Epithets in Action**

**Crack**, **Virtuoso**, and **Legendary** characters are defined by their exceptional competence in chosen fields. You're the person others turn to when they need something done right, and your reputation often precedes you.

**Roleplay Focus**: Take pride in your work and demonstrate professional standards. Mentor others in your field of expertise. Use your reputation to open doors and create opportunities for the team. Balance confidence with humility.

**Example**: Your Legendary Astrogator doesn't just plot courses between planets—you identify optimal routes that save fuel and time, spot navigation hazards that others miss, and use your reputation to gain access to restricted star charts and current space traffic information.

#### **Adventurous Epithets in Action**

**Daring**, **Audacious**, and **Lucky** characters embody the explorer spirit that drives atomic age adventures. You see opportunities where others see obstacles, and your willingness to take calculated risks often opens new possibilities.

**Roleplay Focus**: Suggest bold plans and unconventional approaches. Be the first to volunteer for exciting missions. Inspire others with your enthusiasm for discovery and adventure. Find the positive aspects of challenging situations.

**Example**: When the team discovers an uncharted asteroid with unusual energy readings, your Audacious character proposes an immediate investigation rather than reporting back to authorities first. You see the opportunity for discovery and fame, not just the potential dangers.

#### **Smart Epithets in Action**

**Brilliant**, **Ingenious**, and **Silver-Tongued** characters solve problems through intelligence, creativity, and social skill. You find elegant solutions to complex challenges and help the team navigate both technical and interpersonal obstacles.

**Roleplay Focus**: Ask thoughtful questions and make logical deductions. Propose creative solutions that others might miss. Serve as the team's negotiator and planner. Share interesting facts and insights about discoveries.

**Example**: Your Ingenious character doesn't just repair the broken communication array—you modify it to boost signal strength, create a backup system from spare parts, and develop a protocol for preventing similar failures in the future.

#### **Charming Epithets in Action**

**Stunning**, **Suave**, and **Plucky** characters excel at interpersonal relationships and social situations. You're the team's face, the person who makes connections and smooths over conflicts.

**Roleplay Focus**: Take the lead in social encounters. Build relationships with NPCs that benefit the entire team. Diffuse tensions with humor and charm. Find diplomatic solutions to conflicts.

**Example**: When the team needs information from a suspicious asteroid miner, your Suave character doesn't just ask questions—you buy drinks, share interesting stories from other worlds, and gradually build trust that leads to valuable intelligence about local conditions.

### **EMBRACING ATOMIC AGE TECHNOLOGY**

The technology of 2025 is reliable, powerful, and aesthetically pleasing. Understanding how to interact with atomic age equipment will help you play your character in ways that feel authentic to the setting.

#### **Technology as Partner, Not Master**

Atomic age technology is designed to serve human needs and amplify human capabilities rather than replace human judgment. Your ray gun is a precision instrument that responds to your skill and intent. Your spacecraft's atomic engine provides power, but you provide direction and purpose.

**In Practice**: Describe using technology in active, intentional ways. Don't just "use the scanner"—calibrate it for specific readings, interpret the data it provides, and draw conclusions based on your character's expertise. Trust your equipment while remaining alert to its limitations.

#### **Style Matters**

The atomic age celebrates both function and form. Equipment is beautiful as well as practical, and how you use it reflects your character's personality and professional competence.

**In Practice**: Include aesthetic details when describing your actions. Your ray gun's polished chrome finish catches the light as you draw it. Your spacecraft's elegant control surfaces respond smoothly to your touch. Your vacuum suit's sleek design moves with you rather than constraining you.

#### **Maintenance as Character Expression**

In the atomic age, professionals take pride in maintaining their equipment. A Rocket Jockey's ship reflects their personality and priorities. A Scientist's laboratory reveals their research interests and working methods.

**In Practice**: Describe how your character cares for their equipment. What modifications have you made? What personal touches distinguish your gear from standard models? How does your maintenance routine reflect your character's values and expertise?

### **HANDLING DANGER AND CONFLICT**

The atomic age presents genuine dangers—space pirates, environmental hazards, alien mysteries—but these threats exist to be overcome rather than merely survived. Understanding how to approach danger in ways that feel appropriate to the setting will make your adventures more exciting and satisfying.

#### **Competence Over Luck**

Atomic age heroes succeed through skill, preparation, and teamwork rather than random chance or plot armor. When facing danger, rely on your character's abilities and the team's collective competence.

**In Practice**: Use your skills creatively and describe how your training applies to unusual situations. Work with teammates to combine different expertise areas. Take time to prepare for known dangers rather than rushing headlong into trouble.

#### **Heroism Over Violence**

While the atomic age includes ray gun battles and space combat, violence is rarely the preferred solution to problems. Heroes look for ways to resolve conflicts that preserve life and advance human knowledge.

**In Practice**: Consider negotiation, clever solutions, and strategic withdrawal as alternatives to direct confrontation. When combat is necessary, focus on protecting innocent people and achieving clear objectives rather than causing maximum damage.

#### **Recovery Over Permanent Loss**

The atomic age is fundamentally optimistic about human resilience and the power of science to solve problems. Characters who suffer setbacks recover and learn from their experiences.

**In Practice**: Don't treat character wounds or equipment damage as permanent disasters. The atomic age has excellent medical technology and skilled repair services. Focus on how setbacks create new opportunities and reveal character strengths.

### **BUILDING TEAM DYNAMICS**

Atomic Tomorrow Adventures work best when characters form effective teams that combine different capabilities and perspectives. Understanding how to create positive team dynamics will make everyone's experience more enjoyable.

#### **Complementary Expertise**

Each character's profession and background should contribute something unique to the team's overall capability. Look for ways to support other characters' strengths rather than competing with them.

**In Practice**: Identify what each character does best and create opportunities for them to shine. Ask other characters for help in their areas of expertise. Share discoveries and resources that might benefit teammates' specialties.

#### **Shared Goals**

Effective atomic age teams work toward common objectives that benefit everyone involved. While individual characters might have personal motivations, these should align with rather than conflict with team goals.

**In Practice**: Discuss what your character hopes to achieve and how it relates to team objectives. Look for missions and opportunities that advance multiple characters' interests simultaneously. Compromise when personal and team goals conflict.

#### **Mutual Support**

The vastness of space and the dangers of exploration create natural bonds between team members. Characters who travel together through the void develop trust and loyalty that goes beyond mere professional relationships.

**In Practice**: Show concern for teammates' welfare. Celebrate other characters' successes. Offer help and support during difficult times. Remember shared experiences and reference them in future situations.

### **CREATING MEMORABLE MOMENTS**

The atomic age provides countless opportunities for moments of wonder, triumph, and discovery that will become memorable highlights of your adventures. Understanding how to recognize and enhance these moments will enrich everyone's experience.

#### **Embrace the Spectacle**

The atomic age is inherently dramatic and visually striking. Don't miss opportunities to appreciate and describe the amazing sights and experiences your characters encounter.

**Moments to Savor**: 
- First glimpse of a new world from orbit
- Ancient alien ruins that challenge human understanding  
- The sight of Earth from the observation deck of a space station
- Successful completion of a dangerous rescue mission
- Discovery of a new life form or archaeological treasure

#### **Celebrate Achievements**

When the team accomplishes something significant, take time to acknowledge the achievement and what it means for your characters and the broader human community.

**In Practice**: Discuss how discoveries will advance scientific knowledge. Consider what recognition your characters might receive. Think about how achievements affect your characters' reputations and future opportunities.

#### **Learn from Setbacks**

Even failures and setbacks in the atomic age provide opportunities for growth, learning, and future success. Characters who approach problems scientifically learn from every outcome.

**In Practice**: Analyze what went wrong and what could be done differently next time. Consider how setbacks reveal character strengths or create new story opportunities. Maintain optimism about future attempts and different approaches.

### **LIVING THE ATOMIC DREAM**

Ultimately, Atomic Tomorrow Adventures is about living in a universe where humanity's best impulses—curiosity, cooperation, courage, and hope—drive exploration and discovery among the stars. Your character is part of humanity's greatest adventure, helping to write the story of our species' expansion across the cosmos.

Every adventure contributes to this larger narrative. Every discovery advances human knowledge. Every act of courage and cooperation demonstrates the values that make humanity worthy of the wonders they encounter among the planets.

Play your character as someone who belongs in this optimistic future—someone whose actions and choices help create the atomic tomorrow that science fiction promised and atomic age adventures deliver.

The solar system awaits. The future is bright with atomic fire. Adventure calls from every world and moon.

Answer that call with confidence, curiosity, and the certainty that the best adventures are yet to come.
