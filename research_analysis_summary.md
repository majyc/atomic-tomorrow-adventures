# Research Card System v2.0 - Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

The Monte Carlo simulation reveals several important insights about the new research card system:

### 1. Strategy Effectiveness by Difficulty

**Easy Research (Threshold 4-6)**
- **Conservative** strategy performs best for completion rates (96.1% and 92.4%)
- **Threshold-Focused** strategy is most efficient (3.5 and 3.9 turns average)
- Low failure rates across all strategies (3-12%)

**Hard Research (Threshold 8-10)**
- **Threshold-Focused** strategy dominates both completion rate and efficiency
- At threshold 8: 87% completion vs 77-79% for other strategies
- At threshold 10: 67.4% completion vs 31-54% for other strategies
- Conservative strategy becomes less effective as difficulty increases

### 2. Resource Economics

**Resource Spending Patterns**
- Threshold-Focused: Highest resource consumption (2.2-3.2 per session) but best results
- Aggressive: Lowest resource consumption (0.3-0.7) but poor completion rates
- Conservative/Balanced: Moderate consumption (1.6-1.9) with good easy-task performance

**Resource Efficiency**
- Heavy resource spending pays off primarily on harder research
- For easy tasks, resource conservation strategies work nearly as well
- Threshold-Focused strategy's higher resource use is justified by dramatically better success rates

### 3. Turn Duration Analysis

**Completion Speed**
- **Easy tasks**: 3.5-6.3 turns average across strategies
- **Hard tasks**: 5.2-9.2 turns for completed projects
- Threshold-Focused consistently fastest across all difficulties

**Failure Impact**
- Failed projects average 8-12 turns before abandonment
- High failure rates (40-69% on threshold 10) make completion time critical
- Fast completion reduces exposure to failure conditions

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Game Design
1. **Threshold 6-8** appears to be the sweet spot for engaging difficulty
   - High enough failure risk to create tension
   - Low enough success rate to feel achievable
   
2. **Resource balance** is well-calibrated
   - Players must choose between conservation and success rates
   - Higher difficulties reward resource investment

3. **Hidden track mechanic** works as intended
   - Aggressive strategy shows meaningful differentiation
   - Creates tactical decisions without overwhelming complexity

### For Players
1. **Match strategy to difficulty**
   - Use Conservative for routine research (threshold ≤6)
   - Switch to Threshold-Focused for challenging research (threshold ≥8)

2. **Resource management**
   - Save resources for high-stakes situations
   - Spend freely when threshold requirements are strict

3. **Risk assessment**
   - Hidden tracks become more valuable as visible cards exceed desired difficulty
   - Early project assessment helps choose optimal approach

## System Validation

The simulation validates the core design goals:

✅ **Eliminates dead cards** - All drawn cards contribute to either current progress or future options

✅ **Creates meaningful choices** - Clear strategic differentiation between approaches

✅ **Scales difficulty appropriately** - Exponential challenge increase matches exponential failure consequences

✅ **Maintains player agency** - Multiple viable strategies across difficulty spectrum

✅ **Resource economy works** - Spending decisions matter and create interesting trade-offs

## Next Steps

1. **Playtesting validation** - Real player behavior may differ from algorithmic strategies
2. **Difficulty calibration** - Consider intermediate thresholds (5, 7, 9) for finer granularity  
3. **Resource variety** - Test with different starting resource distributions
4. **Special events** - Implement face card complications in actual play
