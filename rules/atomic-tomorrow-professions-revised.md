# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## PROFESSIONS (COLUMN B)

*In the retro-futuristic future of Atomic Tomorrow, your profession defines your expertise, skills, and role in interplanetary society. This document details the specialized knowledge, equipment, and abilities of each profession.*

## SKILL ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Each profession provides bonuses to specialized skills, with core skills being less focused but broader:

- When a profession grants a specialization, the character also gains the associated core skill at a lower rating
- **Specialization at +40%**: Core skill at +20%
- **Specialization at +20%**: Core skill at +10%
- **Specialization at +10%**: Core skill at +0% (attribute-only)

Each profession grants:
- One primary specialization (+40%)
- One secondary specialization (+20%)
- Two tertiary specializations (+10%)

### Skill Calculation Formula:
Final Skill % = (Attribute × 2) + Skill Bonus
