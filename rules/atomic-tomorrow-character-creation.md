# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## CHARACTER CREATION

*The Solar System of the atomic future needs heroes with grit, charm, and rocket-powered determination. This system guides you through creating a character ready for adventure among the planets.*

## FOUR-COLUMN CHARACTER CREATION

Characters in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures are created by selecting one option from each of four columns, building a complete concept that combines extraordinary qualities, professional expertise, cultural origin, and personal background.

### THE FOUR COLUMNS

| Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **EPITHET** | **PROFESSION** | **ORIGIN** | **BACKGROUND** |
| *What makes you extraordinary* | *What you do* | *Where you're from* | *Your upbringing or past* |

By combining these four elements, you'll create a distinctive character with a clear concept, like "Two-Fisted Rocket Jockey from Mars with a Military Family background" or "Brilliant Scientist from Venus with Academic Training."

## GENERATING ATTRIBUTES

Your seven core attributes form the foundation of your character's capabilities.

### ATTRIBUTE GENERATION BY ORIGIN

- **TERRANS**: Must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 (distributed as desired)
- **ALL OTHER ORIGINS**: Roll 2d10 for each attribute, with results below 3 becoming 3 and results above 18 becoming 18
- **TERRAN EXILES**: May roll attributes like other origins instead of using the Standard Array

The only way to have attributes outside the 3-18 range is through Origin or Background modifiers, which are applied after the initial generation.

### ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, reaction speed
- **NERVE**: Mental composure, courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, craftiness

## COLUMN A: EPITHET

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. It provides special abilities and unique dice roll interpretations that other characters don't possess.

### EPITHET SELECTION

| Epithet | Primary Benefit | Secondary Benefit | Roll Interpretation |

| **Steely-Eyed** | +2 NERVE | Intimidating presence | In tense standoffs, opponents need a critical success to unnerve you |
| **Hotshot** | Natural talent in multiple areas | Show-off maneuvers succeed more often | Pick three skills; for these skills, rolls ending in 1-3 always succeed |
| **Enigmatic** | People find it difficult to read you | Strangers often confide in you | When hiding intentions, opponents need a critical success to see through your deception |
| **Veteran** | Extensive experience | Better situational awareness | Detect ambushes on any successful roll, not just critical success |
| **Hardboiled** | Immune to emotional manipulation | Superior lie detection | Can function without sleep for 48 hours with no penalty |
| **Swashbuckling** | Acrobatic combat expertise | Effective at goading opponents | Acrobatic combat maneuvers succeed on any roll ending in 0, 5, or 9 |
| **Ingenious** | Creative problem-solver | Superior repair capabilities | Can create impromptu tools from available materials on any successful SAVVY roll |
| **Indomitable** | Extremely strong willpower | Can fight through severe injuries | When pursuing a vital objective, wound penalties don't affect your rolls |
| **Silver-Tongued** | +2 CHARM | Superior persuasion | Persuasion attempts that succeed on doubles create lasting belief changes |
