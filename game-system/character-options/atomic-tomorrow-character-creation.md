# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## CHARACTER CREATION

*The Solar System of the atomic future needs heroes with grit, charm, and rocket-powered determination. This system guides you through creating a character ready for adventure among the planets.*

## FOUR-COLUMN CHARACTER CREATION

Characters in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures are created by selecting one option from each of four columns, building a complete concept that combines extraordinary qualities, professional expertise, cultural origin, and personal background.

### THE FOUR COLUMNS

| Column A                         | Column B             | Column C              | Column D                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **EPITHET**                | **PROFESSION** | **ORIGIN**      | **BACKGROUND**        |
| *What makes you extraordinary* | *What you do*      | *Where you're from* | *Your upbringing or past* |

By combining these four elements, you'll create a distinctive character with a clear concept, like "Two-Fisted Rocket Jockey from  Martian Military Family" or "Brilliant Scientist from Venus with Academic Training."

## GENERATING ATTRIBUTES

Your seven core attributes form the foundation of your character's capabilities.

### ATTRIBUTE GENERATION BY ORIGIN

- **TERRANS**: Must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 (distributed as desired)
- **ALL OTHER ORIGINS**: Roll 2d10 for each attribute and arrange, with results below 3 becoming 3 and results above 18 becoming 18
- **TERRAN EXILES**: May roll attributes like other origins instead of using the Standard Array

The only way to have attributes outside the 3-18 range is through Origin or Background modifiers, which are applied after the initial generation.

### ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, reaction speed
- **NERVE**: Mental composure, courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, craftiness

## COLUMN A: EPITHET

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. It provides special abilities and unique dice roll interpretations that other characters don't possess.
