# ARTIFACT RESEARCH

In order to research alien artifacts, or to create new mad science gadgets, investigators must succeed at a series of tasks.  Since it's research, they don't know in advance what the tasks or difficulty levels are going to be, but they can make choices about what approaches to take to solving the problems presented based on their skills and the resources available.  The basic approaches are the Scientific Approach (experimenting and reasoning from first principles), the Engineering/Technical approach (poke around at it, take it apart and see what you can find out), the Xenology/Cultural approach (what do these symbols mean, and what can we infer about it from where we found it or how we believe it was used), and the Intuitive/PSI approach (going with your gut).  The researchers can start with a given approach, but as they uncover more knowledge about it, the best approach for the next segment of the research may shift.  A good research team will have people who are capable in all the facets.

## RESOLUTION

In order to 

## SUITS AS RESEARCH APPROACHES

* ♥️ HEARTS: Intuitive/PSI Approach (Hazard Zone) - Risky but potentially fastest
* ♦️ DIAMONDS: Scientific Approach (Balanced Zone) - Moderate risk/reward
* ♣️ CLUBS: Technical/Engineering Approach (Safe Zone) - Slower but more reliable
* ♠️ SPADES: Xenology/Cultural Approach (Mystery Zone) - Unpredictable outcomes

## CARD VALUES

* **Number Cards (2-10)** : Required Research Points to exit the node
* **Face Cards (J, Q, K)** : Special events (see below)
* **Aces** : Terminal Success nodes
* **Jokers** : Major complications (or return to start)

## SETUP

1. Shuffle the deck and place aside
2. Start with Initial Analysis (draw one card)
3. Players choose their first approach based on skills and resources

## GAMEPLAY FLOW

### Progressing Through a Node:

1. The card value (2-10) indicates Research Points needed to "solve" the node
2. Players make skill checks to accumulate Research Points:
   * Critical Success: 3 Research Points
   * Special Success: 2 Research Points
   * Ordinary Success: 1 Research Point
3. Required skills depend on the suit:
   * Hearts: PSI, NERVE, Intuition
   * Diamonds: Science, Investigation, Analysis
   * Clubs: Engineering, Technology, Repair
   * Spades: Xenology, Cultural studies, Ancient Languages

### Exiting a Node:

1. **Normal Exit (Top Edge)** : Draw next card of the same suit

* If no more cards of that suit, shuffle and draw until matching suit appears

1. **Side Exit (Complication)** : If special failure occurs before completion, draw random card

* Move to this new node (potentially changing approaches)

1. **Success** : Reaching any Ace completes the research

## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Resources can be spent to reduce the Research Points needed:

* Hearts: Spend Energy Units (risk of energy discharge)
* Diamonds: Spend Data Points (scientific approach)
* Clubs: Spend Components (technical approach)
* Spades: Spend Time Units (careful study approach)

For each resource spent, reduce the required Research Points by 1.

## SPECIAL CARDS

### Face Cards

 **Jacks (Challenges)** :

* ♥️ Heart Jack: PSI Feedback - NERVE check or suffer hallucinations
* ♦️ Diamond Jack: Scientific Anomaly - Data becomes contradictory
* ♣️ Club Jack: Technical Malfunction - Component failure
* ♠️ Spade Jack: Cultural Misunderstanding - Translation error

 **Queens (Options)** :

* ♥️ Heart Queen (One-Eyed): Terminal Failure - PSI overload
* ♦️ Diamond Queen: Breakthrough - Reduce any future card value by 2
* ♣️ Club Queen: Stabilization - Immune to next complication
* ♠️ Spade Queen (Bedpost): Terminal Failure - Cultural taboo activated

 **Kings (Power)** :

* ♥️ Heart King: Intuitive Leap - Skip to any card of your choice
* ♦️ Diamond King: Scientific Revelation - Draw 3 cards, choose 1
* ♣️ Club King: Technical Mastery - Automatically complete current node
* ♠️ Spade King (Suicide): Terminal Failure - Ancient security protocol

### Jokers

* **Red Joker** : Major Breakthrough - Move directly to nearest Ace
* **Black Joker** : Catastrophic Failure - Return to start with penalty

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

1. Initial draw: 7 of Clubs
   * Technical approach requiring 7 Research Points
   * Player uses Engineering skill to accumulate points
2. After success, normal exit: 4 of Clubs
   * Another Technical node, easier than the first
   * Player spends 2 Components to reduce requirement to 2 Points
3. During this node, player gets a Special Failure
   * Side exit triggered, drawing a random card
   * Draw: Jack of Hearts (PSI Feedback)
   * Now in Intuitive approach with a complication
4. After resolving complication: Draw 10 of Hearts
   * Very difficult Intuitive node
   * Player decides to spend 4 Energy Units, reducing to 6 Research Points
5. Success leads to: Ace of Hearts
   * Research completed successfully!

## WHY THIS WORKS WELL FOR ATOMIC TOMORROW

1. **Minimal Props** : Uses a standard deck of cards
2. **Unpredictable Paths** : Each research experience is unique
3. **Resource Management** : Strategic decisions about when to spend resources
4. **Team Cooperation** : Different character types excel with different suits
5. **Path Dependency** : Your current position affects your options forward
6. **Special Success/Failure** : Core ATA mechanics integrated into progression

This system captures the feel of exploring alien technology with false starts, complications, and breakthroughs, while using familiar props and maintaining the pulp sci-fi aesthetic of Atomic Tomorrow Adventures. The playing card approach makes each artifact research unique without requiring extensive GM prep.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this system further?
