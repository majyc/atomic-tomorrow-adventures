# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## SPECIAL COMBAT CIRCUMSTANCES

### ZERO-G COMBAT

Zero-gravity environments fundamentally change how combat works, turning brute strength into a potential liability and rewarding those with proper training.

**Basic Zero-G Rules:**

- All actions requiring physical movement use Athletics (Zero-G Movement) skill
- Characters without this skill suffer -40% penalty to all physical actions
- Every successful attack also moves the attacker unless properly anchored

**Attribute Adjustments:**

- High BRAWN becomes a hindrance: For every point of BRAWN above 10, apply -5% to Zero-G Movement attempts
- Characters with the "Two-Fisted" epithet can use one hand to anchor themselves, reducing penalties

**Movement and Positioning:**

- Characters can move between zones only with appropriate equipment:
  - Maneuvering jets (hand, belt, or backpack)
  - Tethers or magnetic grapples
  - Using weapon recoil (requires sacrifice of ammunition)
- Failed movement rolls result in uncontrolled tumbling: -20% to all actions until stabilized
- Direction matters: Characters can be "above," "below," or on any side relative to others

**Weapon Considerations:**

- Recoil affects the user: Firing heavy weapons without anchoring propels user backward
- Recoil can be used deliberately to move between zones (using Combat roll instead of Athletics)
- Projectile weapons function normally
- Energy weapons are preferred due to minimal recoil

**Special Zero-G Tactics:**

- Anchored Position: Character using magnetic boots or tether gains +20% to combat rolls but cannot easily change position
- Tumbling Attack: Intentionally tumbling while attacking makes you harder to hit (-20% to be hit) but imposes -20% on your own attack
- Ricocheting: Can intentionally bounce off surfaces with Athletics (Zero-G) roll to approach from unexpected angles

### COVER & POSITIONING

**Taking Cover:**

- Dropping prone provides additional protection (-1 wound)
- This stacks with other cover bonuses
- In zero-G, "prone" means presenting smallest profile toward opponent

**Cover Types:**

| Cover Type                           | Protection         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Partial (crate, thin wall)           | -1 wound           |
| Good (reinforced door, thick pillar) | -2 wounds          |
| Excellent (bunker slot, vehicle)     | -3 wounds          |
| Full (completely hidden)             | Cannot be targeted |

**Environmental Positioning:**

Flanking, back-stabbing, attacking from a higher position, attacking with surprise, and any other situational modifiers should be decided by the GM on the fly, and if it's reasonable either the target should suffer a modifier to Defense or perhaps be unable to actively defend at all. In other cases one of the standard modifiers (-20, -40, etc.) should be applied. Often there should be an opposed role, say of Guile vs. Savvy, to check if the character has been sneaky enough to earn the bonus.

### SUPER-SIMPLE COMBAT MANEUVERS

This elegant system allows for tactical depth without additional complexity. With any successful attack, the attacker can declare a desired effect instead of doing damage.

**Super Simple Mechanic:**

1. Attacker declares desired effect along with attack
2. If attack succeeds, defender chooses:
   - Accept the declared effect (disarm, knockdown, push, etc.)
   - Refuse and take normal damage instead

**Critical Success Enhancement:**
If the attack is a critical success, the defender must accept the declared effect and cannot choose to take damage instead.

**Common Maneuvers:**

- **Disarm**: Target drops weapon or item
- **Trip/Knockdown**: Target falls prone
- **Push**: Target moves back one zone or position
- **Pin**: Target cannot move until they break free
- **Stun**: Target suffers -20% to next action
- **Grab Item**: Snatch an item from target
- **Distract**: Target cannot use defensive actions next round
- **Reposition**: Force target to move to specific position in zone

**Tactical Considerations:**

- Clever players can use maneuvers to set up advantageous situations
- NPCs will generally accept the effect if it's less harmful than taking a wound
- Some opponents may have specific vulnerabilities that make certain maneuvers more effective

### SPECIALIZED ENVIRONMENTS

**Underwater Combat:**

- All non-specialized ranged weapons have range reduced by one category
- Energy weapons function at -1 wound rating
- Melee attacks suffer -20% penalty due to water resistance
- Movement between zones requires Athletics (Swimming) roll

**Extreme Gravity:**

- High Gravity: Every action requires a BRAWN roll to avoid exhaustion (-10% cumulative penalty)
- Each wound counts as two for purposes of incapacitation
- Range of all weapons reduced by one category
- BRAWN bonus to damage is doubled

### BREATHING HAZARDS

**Vacuum Exposure:**

- Exposure without protection: 1 wound per round
- Explosive decompression: Athletics roll or 2 wounds immediately
- Helmet breach: 3 rounds of useful consciousness to seal breach
- Being spaced: Requires Athletics (Zero-G) roll at -20% to grab something within reach

**Drowning/Suffocation:**

- Can hold breath for a number of rounds equal to GRIT
- After that period, suffer 1 wound per round
- No roll can extend this period - it's a hard biological limit
- Strenuous activity (combat, swimming) reduces time to GRIT ÷ 2 rounds

**Toxic Atmospheres:**

- Mild toxin: GRIT × 5 roll each hour or 1 wound
- Severe toxin: GRIT × 5 roll each minute or 1 wound
- Caustic atmosphere: Damages equipment, requiring Repair rolls after exposure

### EXOTIC WEAPON EFFECTS

**Alien or Mad Scientist Technology:**

- Morphic Weapons: Change form based on user's intent
- Bio-Organic: Self-healing but requires specific environmental conditions
- Forerunner Artifacts: Unpredictable effects, often tied to user's PSI attribute
