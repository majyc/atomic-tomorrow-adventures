# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## INTERPLANETARY COMMERCE SYSTEM

*The dusty spaceport bars of Mars and the gleaming commerce centers of Earth all echo with the same tales: daring traders who struck it rich hauling exotic tech from Venus to the Belt, or desperate captains who lost everything on a hold full of Venusian silk that nobody would buy. In the atomic age, interplanetary commerce offers both opportunity and risk for those bold enough to stake their claim among the stars.*

## CORE MECHANICS

The Atomic Tomorrow trading system simulates the challenge of finding profitable cargo routes across the Solar System. Players use their Trading skill to acquire goods at one location and sell them at another, navigating the economic complexities of different worlds.

### KEY CONCEPTS

- **Cargo Value Rating**: Represents the quality, rarity, and desirability of goods (1-10)
- **Location Wealth Rating**: Represents a location's economic development and available capital (1-10)
- **Market Specialties**: Locations can produce, consume, or restrict different types of goods
- **Persistence**: Traders can make multiple attempts to sell cargo or try different locations

## CARGO CATEGORIES

1. **Agricultural Products**: Foodstuffs, plants, seeds, organic materials
2. **Raw Materials**: Ores, chemicals, water, construction materials
3. **Manufactured Goods**: Clothing, tools, appliances, processed items
4. **Luxury Items**: Art, exotic goods, gourmet products, entertainment
5. **Technology**: Scientific equipment, computers, advanced devices
6. **Medical Supplies**: Medicines, surgical equipment, biological materials
7. **Military Hardware**: Weapons, armor, security systems (often restricted)
8. **Exotic Materials**: Alien artifacts, rare elements, unique substances

### CARGO VALUE RATINGS

- **Low Value (1-3)**: Common goods, bulk resources, basic supplies
- **Medium Value (4-7)**: Processed goods, standard technology, specialized equipment
- **High Value (8-10)**: Luxury items, advanced technology, rare materials

### CARGO SIZE

- **Small Cargo (1 SCU)**: +20% to acquisition roll, -10% to selling roll
- **Standard Cargo (2 SCUs)**: No modifiers
- **Large Cargo (4 SCUs)**: -20% to acquisition roll, +10% to selling roll

## LOCATION RATINGS

### WEALTH RATING

- **Poor (1-3)**: Frontier outposts, struggling colonies, remote stations
- **Medium (4-7)**: Established colonies, industrial centers, trading hubs
- **Wealthy (8-10)**: Major planetary metropolises, luxury stations, corporate headquarters

### MARKET SPECIALTIES

- **Production**: Location creates these goods efficiently (easier to buy)
- **Consumption**: Location needs these goods (easier to sell)
- **Restricted**: Location heavily regulates these goods (harder to buy and sell)

   - Apply cargo size modifiers if applicable

3. **Resolution**:
   - If your highest die equals or exceeds the cargo's highest die, you can purchase it

### SELLING CARGO

   - If selling at a Poor location (Wealth 1-3) that Consumes this cargo: +1 to the price die
   - If successfully selling Restricted goods: +2 to the price die
   - Your profit (or loss) is the difference between selling price and purchase price

## PERSISTENCE RULES

### MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT SAME LOCATION

- If a selling attempt fails, the trader may try again after 1d6 days
- Each location allows up to 3 attempts before requiring the trader to leave and return after at least one week
- Each attempt requires a new Trading skill check and selling roll

### LOCATION HOPPING

- Different locations can be tried without restrictions
- Travel time and cost should be considered when determining overall profitability

### EMERGENCY OFFLOADING

If a trader cannot sell cargo after multiple attempts:
- They can accept a lowball offer for 70% of their purchase price
- They can trade the cargo for other goods of equivalent value
- They can store the cargo at a licensed warehouse for 10% of its value per month

## TRADING STRATEGIES

Based on extensive simulations, certain trade approaches are more profitable than others:

### OPTIMAL STRATEGIES

1. **Low Value Goods at Medium Wealth Consumption Areas**
   - Example: Agricultural Products from Mars to Belt Colonies
   - Highest reliability (40%+ success rate)
   - Moderate profits per trip (200-300 credits)

2. **Medium Value Goods at Medium-High Wealth Consumption Areas**
   - Example: Raw Materials from Mars to Earth
   - Good balance of reliability (25-30% success rate)
   - Good profits per trip (300-500 credits)

3. **Location Hopping with Multiple Selling Options**
   - Acquire cargo at Production areas
   - Try selling at different locations in order of preference
   - Much more profitable than fixed routes

4. **Persistence at Wealthy Locations**
   - Make multiple attempts to sell at wealthy locations
   - Can increase profits by 100-500% compared to single attempts

### TRADE SEQUENCE EXAMPLE

   - Trading skill 65%, rolls 43 (success, +1 bonus)
   - Rolls 7, 3 for Trading; with +1 bonus and +2 Production bonus = 10, 3
   - Rolls 5+2, 3+2 for cargo = 7, 5

2. She flies to Mars (Consumption area) to sell
   - Trading skill 65%, rolls 25 (special success, +2 bonus)
   - Rolls 4+2, 1+2 for cargo; with +2 bonus and +2 Consumption bonus = 8, 3
   - Rolls 7+6, 4+6 for location wealth = 13, 10

## TRADE MASTER TIPS

1. **Know Your Markets**: Study which locations produce and consume which goods
2. **Diversify Your Approach**: Be willing to try multiple locations rather than fixating on one
3. **Consider Travel Costs**: Factor in fuel and time when planning routes
4. **Use Persistence**: Don't give up after a single failed selling attempt
5. **Invest in Skills**: Higher Trading skill dramatically improves long-term profitability
6. **Listen for Rumors**: Market events can create temporary but lucrative opportunities
7. **Exploit Specialties**: The Production-to-Consumption pipeline is always most profitable

*"Buy low, sell high, and know when to jettison the cargo before the Patrol comes knocking. That's the Trader's Creed, kid." - Captain Liza "Lucky" Goldstein, veteran Belt trader*
