# Optional Hit Location System

## Reading the Attack Roll

When an attack hits, the location struck is determined by adding the two digits from the percentile roll, with 0 interpreted as 10. This gives us a range from 2-19.

**Example:** A roll of 27 means 2+7=9, hitting the abdomen.

## Hit Location Table

| Sum | Location | Effects | Targeted Shot Penalty |
|-----|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 2-3 | Foot | Movement reduced by 25%. Critical: Target knocked down | -60% |
| 4-5 | Leg | Movement reduced by 50%. Critical: Target knocked down | -20% |
| 6-7 | Hip | Movement reduced by 50%. Critical: Target immobilized | -20% |
| 8-9 | Abdomen | +1 damage. Critical: Target winded (-20% for 1d3 rounds) | -20% |
| 10-11 | Chest | +1 damage. Critical: Target stunned for 1 round | -20% |
| 12-13 | Shoulder | -20% to actions with that arm. Critical: Arm disabled | -40% |
| 14-15 | Arm | -20% to actions with that arm. Critical: Item dropped | -40% |
| 16-17 | Hand | Item dropped. Critical: Hand disabled | -60% |
| 18 | Neck | +2 damage. Critical: Target stunned for 1d3 rounds | -60% |
| 19 | Head | +2 damage. Critical: Target knocked unconscious | -40% |

If the attack is successful, use the targeted location instead of the roll. If a special or critical success occurs, apply the appropriate effects regardless of which body part was targeted.

## Determining Left vs. Right

For limbs (arms, legs, etc.), determine which side:
- If the tens digit is odd: Left side
- If the tens digit is even: Right side
- If tens digit is 0: The dominant side (right for right-handed characters, left for left-handed)

## Armor Considerations

Not all armor covers the entire body. The referee may determine that certain hit locations aren't protected by a character's armor.

| Armor Type | Coverage |
|------------|----------|
| Light Armor (Vac-suit, Leather) | Full coverage except hands, possibly head |
| Medium Armor (Combat Suit) | Full coverage |
| Heavy Armor (Battle Armor) | Full coverage including helmet |
| Helmet | Head only |
| Arm/Leg Guards | Specific limbs only |

## Alien Anatomies

For non-human targets, the referee should adapt the hit location chart appropriately:

- **Martian Masterminds**: Head results may disable their psychic abilities
- **Mysterians**: Targeting their environmental apparatus (shoulder/neck) might force retreat
- **Venusian Dinosaurs**: Hip results may affect tail instead with different consequences
