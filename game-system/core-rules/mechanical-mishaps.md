# ATOMIC TOMORROW: MECHANICAL MISHAPS

## THE MAINTENANCE ENCOUNTER CONCEPT

Rather than tracking individual components or complex wear systems, maintenance in Atomic Tomorrow happens through dramatic "encounters" that arise at narratively appropriate moments:

- During long voyages between planets
- After experiencing extreme environmental conditions
- Following combat or other high-stress system usage
- When attempting to start long-mothballed equipment

## MAINTENANCE CARDS

Each maintenance encounter could be represented by a card drawn from a specialized deck (or a randomized table if physical cards aren't feasible).

### CARD STRUCTURE

Each card includes:

- **System Affected**: Engine, Life Support, Navigation, etc.
- **Urgency Level**: Routine, Concerning, Critical
- **Technical Challenge**: The nature of the problem
- **Required Skills**: Primary and secondary skills needed
- **Parts Required**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Improvised
- **Consequences**: What happens if not addressed

### SAMPLE MAINTENANCE CARD: "PRESSURE VALVE OSCILLATION"

```
SYSTEM: Engine Cooling
URGENCY: Concerning (48 hours until Critical)
CHALLENGE: Cooling system pressure valves are exhibiting harmonic vibration
SKILLS: Engineering (Mechanical) primary, Repair (Improvised) secondary
PARTS: Common (replacement valve) OR Improvised (manual regulator)
CONSEQUENCES: Engine efficiency drops 25%, risk of overheating during high output
```

## RESOLUTION MECHANICS

Engineers tackle these challenges through a variation of the core d100 system:

### 1. DIAGNOSIS PHASE

- Engineer makes Perception (Technical) or appropriate specialization check
- **Ordinary Success**: Identifies the problem
- **Special Success**: Also identifies optimal solution path
- **Critical Success**: Also identifies a creative alternative solution
- **Special Failure**: Misdiagnoses part of the problem
- **Critical Failure**: Completely misunderstands the issue, potential to worsen

### 2. REPAIR PHASE

- Engineer makes check using primary required skill
- **Ordinary Success**: Problem resolved standardly
- **Special Success**: Problem resolved with improved performance
- **Critical Success**: System works better than before the issue
- **Special Failure**: Temporary fix, will recur in half normal time
- **Critical Failure**: Creates a secondary, related problem

### 3. PARTS ACQUISITION

If parts are needed:

- **Common**: Available on any vessel or outpost
- **Uncommon**: Available at major settlements, might need purchase
- **Rare**: Only at specialized facilities or through trade
- **Improvised**: Can be fabricated with successful Engineering check

## IMPROVISATION MECHANICS

For true Atomic Age pulp feel, engineers can attempt "miracle fixes" using unorthodox methods:

### THE MIRACLE FIX

1. Engineer describes their unorthodox approach
2. GM sets appropriate difficulty (-20% to -40%)
3. On success, problem is temporarily solved
4. Special success extends the fix duration
5. Critical success makes the improvisation permanent

### CLASSIC IMPROVISATION METHODS

- Recalibrating with a perfectly-timed hammer strike
- Rerouting systems through unexpected components
- Using personal items in creative technical applications
- Reversing the polarity of neutron flow (always a classic!)

## COLLABORATIVE MAINTENANCE

Multiple characters can contribute to maintenance challenges:

- **The Primary Engineer**: Makes the main technical checks
- **The Assistant**: Can provide a bonus through a secondary skill
- **The Parts Scrounger**: Can improve parts availability
- **The Distraction Manager**: Keeps other crises at bay during repairs

This system gives engineers their moment to shine without requiring complex tracking. Each maintenance challenge becomes a mini-adventure with meaningful decisions, creative problem-solving opportunities, and consequences that matter without overwhelming the gameplay. It's particularly well-suited to the retro-atomic aesthetic, where technical problems are solved through ingenuity rather than advanced diagnostics.

## SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DILEMMAS

Mirroring the medical system's treatment dilemmas:

### EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS

| Technical Solution              | Primary Effect                                            | Side Effect                                                                                               | Duration                                              | Best For                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emergency Bypass**      | Restores full system function                             | System suffers 1 damage when effect ends; requires GRIT-like engineering check or system fails completely | Until Engineering check succeeds (checked each hour)  | Critical situations requiring immediate function           |
| **System Throttling**     | System operates at 80% capacity with no additional damage | Masks worsening conditions                                                                                | 24 hours                                              | Long missions where complete failure would be catastrophic |
| **Power Surge**           | Temporarily restores full functionality                   | -40% efficiency after effect ends; second application risks complete burnout                              | Until Engineering check succeeds (checked every 4hrs) | Operations with recovery time available afterward          |
| **Component Redirection** | Redirect strain to non-essential systems                  | Double wear on those systems; increased failure chance                                                    | Until Engineering check succeeds (checked every 3hrs) | When specific functions must operate at full capacity      |

### SPECIALIZED REPAIRS

| Repair Method                      | Best For                 | Not For              | Side Effect                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Structural Reinforcement** | Mechanical stress damage | Electronic systems   | Reduced flexibility in affected components |
| **Circuit Recalibration**    | Electronic fluctuations  | Mechanical failures  | -20% efficiency in affected subsystems     |
| **Emergency Patch**          | General damage           | Doesn't fully repair | Requires comprehensive service afterward   |

## VENUS-SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

### MEDICAL DILEMMA: JUNGLE FEVER

* Patient exhibits symptoms after jungle exposure
* Multiple treatment options with different side effects
* Balance immediate recovery against long-term complications

### TECHNICAL PARALLEL: ATMOSPHERIC INFILTRATION

* Aircraft systems show signs of Venusian atmospheric contamination
* Multiple repair approaches with different consequences
* Balance immediate flight capability against long-term system damage

## THE DECISION TREE APPROACH

Both systems can use identical decision tree structures:

1. **Is system/patient at critical status?**
   * YES → Emergency intervention or immediate shutdown
   * NO → Continue to step 2
2. **Is immediate full function required?**
   * YES → Temporary solution with side effects
   * NO → Continue to step 3
3. **What is damage/injury type?**
   * MECHANICAL/BLUNT → Appropriate repair/treatment
   * ELECTRONIC/ENERGY → Appropriate repair/treatment
   * ENVIRONMENTAL → Appropriate repair/treatment
   * MIXED → General solution (safest option)

This parallel structure ensures that players who master one system will intuitively understand the other, while still providing distinct flavor and specialization for different character types.

By aligning these systems, we create a consistent gameplay rhythm across different technical specialties without forcing players to learn entirely new mechanics. The underlying structure remains the same while the specific flavor, terminology, and application change to fit the domain.

Would you like me to develop specific examples of technical dilemmas that mirror particular medical ones from the existing system? Or perhaps create a full set of parallel cards showing how the same mechanical structure works in both domains?
