Steps To Creating A Character for Zap! {#sec:CharSteps}
--------------------------------------

*Before you begin* the GM or entire group decides certain aspects
of the campaign, such as Scope, basic setting, Tone, and campaign
goals before character creation. For example, the campaign could be
light-hearted and set in a Space Cadet Academy, with most characters
being Academy students, a serious relatively hard SF campaign about
the crew of a interstellar scout ship seeking out new worlds and new
civilizations, a grim post-apocalyptic setting where the characters
are survivors of a devastating biological war, or even a "space
opera" western-in-space. This campaign information affects character
creation in informal ways, such as deciding that a hard bitten space
bounty hunter or a member of a semi-mystical order of Star Knights
is an appropriate character concept. There are also two mechanical
ways the campaign's design affects player character creation. First,
the Scope of the campaign will determine the personal power level
of the characters, at least at the beginning. Secondly, the GM will
decide on or create templates for standard creature types available
as player characters. For example, templates for particular alien
races means aliens PCs and NPCs will be relatively common, and specifies
what exactly is true of those aliens in the game.

### Before You Begin: Scope and Tone

Before you actually start creating characters, you need to make some
decisions about the kind of science fiction game you want to play.
The GM and the players should collectively decide on the Scope for
the adventures, and the Tone that the game will take. Is the group
going to be a rag-tag bunch of survivors of an apocalypse trying to
hang on one more day, the crew of a starship trying to eke a living
on the frontier or carry out missions assigned by Star Command, guardians
of an entire galaxy fighting a war against extra-galactic invaders,
or something else? Will the players be average Joes with some specialized
training and gear, elite commandos with state-of-the-art equipment,
futuristic supermen and women with psionic or technological powers
that grant them godlike abilities? Is death and dying something that
rarely happens to PCs, and can usually be "fixed" with appropriate
technology, or will it be a minor triumph if the PCs survive an adventure,
or somewhere in between?

### Adventure Scope and Personal Scope {#sec:Scope}

Scope describes how large an area the characters' typical adventures
take place in and how powerful they are individually. The Adventure
Scope refers to the size of the area they typically travel within
and is usually tied to their available means of transportation; the
Personal Scope refers to how much ability the individual characters
have to affect the outcomes of things within the area of the adventure.
The two are related, but not identical. For instance, it is common
in science fiction to have adventures take the heroes from star system
to star system, while the heroes themselves are little more than average
Joes and Janes who might find themselves mugged in a back-alley of
some starport if they're not careful; on the flip side, you have stories
like some Roger Zelazny novels such as *Lord of Light* where
the characters are literally godlike in power but the entire action
of the story is confined to one world. While campaigns may eventually
transcend the original Scopes, you should pick a Personal Scope at
the start that will be satisfactory to play for quite some time. Most
of the time in science fiction, characters who "level up" and
significantly change their Personal Scope either do so at the start,
and that's what kicks off their adventures, or gain great power at
the end and use it to resolve things\...it's relatively unusual to
have a sequels at the new level of power remain as interesting. Groups
that want to try different power levels as a change of pace might
consider creating new characters in the same setting but at the desired
Scope, and returning to the lower-powered characters when they feel
like more down-to-Earth adventures, rather than ramping up the original
characters with newly discovered powers, symbiotic alien tech, and
the like. On the other hand, Adventure Scopes regularly increase over
the course of science fiction stories, as the characters find themselves
visiting far-flung places and interacting with larger and larger areas
of the setting. Note that many famous SF characters, even ones who
regularly win fights, would only count as Scope 1 Normals. If you
can imagine the character actually needing to surrender or flee when
confronted with a fire-team of four soldiers with rifles leveled,
that character is probably Scope 1. Note also that characters may
be in command of ships or organizations well above their own in Scope.
The same shoulder-rolling starship Captain that finds it wise to surrender
to a fire team of four soldiers may command a vessel that could fight
an entire army, or even planet, on equal terms.

#### Adventure Scopes

1.  **Normal** Does not go on adventures unless pressed.

2.  **Agent** You are part of a large group that provides
    support, missions, and transportation. While you rarely make a crucial
    difference individually, your group works for larger aims. Organizations
    can themselves vary in Scope and power-level, but most of their operatives
    will still be at the agent power-level, whether they are the local
    police department or a world-conquering conspiracy. The differences
    will be in the number of agents, the equipment provided to the agents,
    and the number and level of higher-powered officers and specialists
    that work alongside them.

3.  **Street-level** You do not have reliable
    intel or transportation, so you need to plan ahead to be in the right
    place to influence events. Thus, your missions are usually chosen
    to suit your talents and centered on individuals, rather than responding
    to crises. Examples: *Damnation Alley, Escape from New York*.

4.  **Neighborhood** You adventure mainly in
    a city district or equivalent area, such as a small to medium-sized
    town. You have ways of learning about major events in your district,
    and reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to
    these events. Examples: *Eureka*.

5.  **City** You adventure mainly in a major metropolis.
    You have ways of learning about major events in your city, and reliable
    transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these events.
    Examples: *Sliders* (the city changes from episode to episode,
    but they never move far from the location of the vortex).

6.  **Regional** You adventure mainly in a geographical
    area, such as a group of US States (e.g., New England), a large US
    State (e.g., California) or a moderate-sized country (e.g., the Netherlands).
    You have ways of learning about major events in your region, and reliable
    transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these events.
    Examples: *Men in Black*.

7.  **National** You adventure throughout a large
    country (e.g., USA) or continent (e.g., Europe or Australia). You
    have ways of learning about major events anywhere in this area, and
    reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these
    events. Examples: *Warehouse 13*.

8.  **Global** You adventure throughout the world.
    You have ways of learning about major events anywhere in the world,
    and reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to
    these events. Examples: *Thunderbirds*, *U.F.O*.

9.  **Interplanetary** Your operations frequently
    go beyond this world. You have ways of learning about major events
    on other worlds and transportation that allows you to reach other
    worlds within the star system in a reasonable amount of time. Examples:
    *Firefly*, *Flash Gordon*.

10. **Near Interstellar** You travel throughout
    the local stellar system, and frequently to nearby stars. You have
    ways of learning about major events on other worlds and transportation
    that allows you to reach other worlds in a reasonable amount of time.
    Examples: *Star Trek: Deep Space 9, Starship Troopers*

11. **Star Cluster** You adventure over many
    worlds. You may represent a federation or other group of many planets.
    You have ways of learning about major events throughout your jurisdiction
    and transportation sufficient to reach them effectively. Examples:
    *Star Trek, StarWars*, *Stainless Steel Rat*.

12. **Galactic Arm** Your adventures extend
    into most of the known worlds. Examples: *Lensmen, Perry Rhodan,
    Doctor Who*

13. **Galaxy** Your adventures extend across the entire
    Galaxy.

14. **Galactic Cluster** Your adventures
    extend across a cluster of Galaxies.

15. **Cosmic** There is no bound to the scope of your
    operations. Examples: *Star Maker*

#### Personal Scopes

1.  **Normal** A normal, if trained person. Can emerge
    victorious from a brawl\...sometimes.

2.  **Agent** An elite combatant. Can take on 10 civilians
    in a barroom brawl, several squad-cars of police, or a fire team of
    4 soldiers.

3.  **Street-level** Augmented. Can take on
    50 civilians, or a squad of 8-12 soldiers.

4.  **Neighborhood** Inhuman. Can take on 100
    civilians, or a platoon of around 25 soldiers.

5.  **City** Super-powered. Can take on an infantry
    company of 200 soldiers.

6.  **Regional** Can take on a battalion of 1000
    soldiers.

7.  **National** Can take on a division of 10,000
    soldiers.

8.  **Global** Can take on an army of 100,000 soldiers.

9.  **Interplanetary** Can take on an army
    group of 1,000,000 soldiers.

10. **Near Interstellar** Can take on an
    entire theater of war, 10,000,000 soldiers.

11. **Far Interstellar** Can take on a planet.

12. **Star Cluster** Can take on a solar system.

13. **Galactic Arm** Can take on a stellar cluster.

14. **Galaxy** Can take on an entire interstellar
    civilization.

15. **Cosmic** Can take on an entire galaxy.

### Tone {#sec:Tone}

Tone is probably the single most important decision about your campaign.
Tone is about the way the game feels, the mood and the atmosphere
of the adventures. You can and should vary the tone somewhat from
session to session, and within a session, but there will be a prevailing
mood to the game. SF adventure ranges from Flash Gordon to Firefly
to Alien, from Lost in Space through Star Trek to the rebooted Battlestar:
Galactica. This tone will actually influence game play. The lighter
the tone, the less plausible justifications for SF abilities have
to be, and the freakier coincidences can be.

Modern SF can also touch on sensitive subjects: sex, violence, and
religion. There's no right or wrong answer, but a clash of expectations
can lead to incoherence between the tone the GM is trying to set and
what actually happens, or players being out of sync with the others.
It can even lead to players finding the game unpleasant, disturbing,
or disgusting (or in the other direction, too silly, angsty or sentimental
to stomach). Make sure everybody playing is on basically the same
page, and give notice in advance if there will be possibly disturbing
elements. Disagreements over the tone of the campaign can wreck it;
when one player is aiming for goofy Saturday-morning cartoon style
with a post-apocalyptic barbarian armed with a laser sword in a world
of savagery, super-science and sorcery, and another wants to play
an ordinary crew member aboard a space-going refinery trying eke out
a living, something's got to give. Even if the players are nominally
on the same page with the style of character, the Primary Rule of
having to make sure that your actions sound like a science fiction
story places emphasis on having at least rough agreement as to what
kind of story people have in mind. If one player is trying to stick
to real-world science as much as possible while another takes his
cue from the most over-the-top Japanese anime the result won't tend
to feel like either.

One useful way to approach this is to describe your game as similar
to a source that all the players are familiar with, e.g., is it more
like Firefly, Robert Heinlein novels, Warhammer 40K, or StarWars?
That doesn't have to mean it's set in those settings, but it does
set the expectations for things like levels of violence, humor, plausibility
of physical stunts, just how cosmic or contrived are technological
devices and super-science abilities, and so forth.

#### We can rebuild him\...

Zap! has no hard-and-fast rules for characters meeting accidental
deaths in combat. This shouldn't stop you from making the game as
deadly as you and the players want it to be. Given sufficient science
fictional hand-waving, characters can be repaired by advanced medical
tech or restored from backup, be revived as cyborgs or AI simulations
in android bodies, be replaced by a clone or parallel universe twin.
Player characters should really only die permanently when the players
want them to, but that doesn't mean they don't have a lot at stake.
Lethality among minor characters is a matter of tone. Out can be narrated
as dead for minions or bystanders, or you can have even Overkilled
NPCs make it out alive.

The tone of the campaign might mean that you do brutal things to player
characters. But even in games that are maximally edgy and morbid,
players should have long-term control over their characters paths.
You should never force a player to run a character that is warped
beyond recognition from their original concept. If they are not done
having fun with the character, find a plot device to allow them to
revert back. Sometimes a PC will need to be retired and run as an
NPC, letting the player start afresh.

### Quick-and-dirty player character creation

Here's the shortest way to make up an Zap! character.

1.  Think of what kind of character you'd want to play that fits the tone
    and setting.

2.  Pick the closest match to that character in the .

3.  Keep all the numerical values of that sample character. For each descriptive
    phrase on the sample character sheet, replace it with a phrase of
    the same general category that describes the character you have in
    mind.

### Outline

If no sample character is a close match, or you want to have complete
control over character generation, you can follow these steps instead.
This is an overview, with details in subsequent sections.
*Steps:*

1.  **Decide on a Concept.** Pick a concept for your character. Captain
    of a scout ship? Xenobiologist studying alien creatures? Alien creature?
    Interstellar bounty hunter? This is the most important step, and one
    where you might want to consult the other players and the GM, so players
    are matching in tone and consistent with the setting.

2.  **Fill in a Template**. Templates in Zap! reflect the character's
    role in the game, as well as their abilities. So your concept should
    pretty much determine which template to use: crew (few amazing combat
    powers, but extraordinarily skillful and brave), bad-ass (trained
    combatant), scientist (invents new SF devices and has knowledge of
    the setting's scientific principles), unique (one-of-a-kind esper
    or alien), or any of a number of templates that the GM has designed
    for standard SF creatures in her setting.\
    \
    For example, PCs might be Captain Ace Astra (crew); Ace's best friend
    and ship's science officer Tok (scientist); Solitaire Jones, a space
    smuggler and Ace's boyfriend (bad-ass); Spotty, a genetically "uplifted"
    dog and ship's engineering officer (unique); and Tira, a shape-changing
    alien (based on an alien template the GM has created for this campaign).
    Once you've found the right Template for your concept, fill in the
    blanks in the Template with descriptions of your character's particular
    abilities (and weaknesses). There are three kinds of things needing
    descriptions at this point: Powers, Restrictions, and Shticks. Each
    template has some slots for Powers and Shticks, and some have places
    for Restrictions. Powers are abilities that can be used in or out
    of combat, Shticks are strictly non-combat abilities, and Restrictions
    are biological or technological limitations on your character. The
    Template might have some of these pre-defined, or give broad categories
    they should fall into. Others will be completely up to you to decide.
    Unless they are pre-defined by the Template, you need to to define
    what they are and how they work.\
    \
    For example, the Crew template has a "defensive power", but you
    can define this as a psychological ploy to "Keep 'em Talking"
    until help arrives, "Don't Attract Attention" where alien creatures
    ignore your presence, Luck, Athleticism, Danger sense, Invisibility,
    Force Shield, or whatever ability of that general type best suits
    your character concept. On the other hand, an Alien: Mara template
    might gives all Mara the same Shapeshift and Empathy powers. These
    do not need to be defined, the template already specifies what they
    do.\
    \
    Powers and Shticks descriptions are free-form; there is no fixed list
    of possibilities. They have numerical ratings that tell how effective
    they are when used, but it's up to you to determine what they are,
    and how and when they can be used. Restrictions are completely binding
    on your character, so they are not given numerical ratings. E.g.,
    No matter how powerful a Mara is, ultrasonics render it helpless,
    period.

3.  **Spend your Boosts.** You then have a certain number of "Boosts"
    to spend on your character, usually 3. These increase your character's
    abilities. Each Boost can be spent for one of the following:

    1.  Add one to one of the four Attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and
        Actions.

    2.  Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage. 2 Boosts
        give it a big Advantage.

    3.  Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.

    4.  Add one new Power. The starting level is given in your template.

    5.  Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one
        Shtick at one higher level.

    6.  Get a Major Asset (companion, base, vehicle, organization, or wealth).
        You can then spend additional Boosts to improve these.

    7.  Get three Minor Assets (perks, contacts, favors, rank, equipment).

4.  **Adjust Abilities (Powers and Shticks).** You can adjust your
    Abilities further by reducing the effectiveness of certain aspects
    of the Ability in order to increase its Level or take some Advantages
    on it. Every Small Disadvantage you put on the Ability gives you one
    Boost to spend on Advantages for that Power or to raise its Level;
    every Big Disadvantage gives you two Boosts. Similarly, for each Level
    you lower the Ability you get an additional Boost to spend on that
    Power. You can't trade Boosts from one Ability to spend on another.
    Modifying an Ability this way doesn't affect how many total Boosts
    you have, so doesn't change how much XP you need for a new Boost.

5.  **Pick Complications.** All protagonists have life issues that
    complicate their attempts to achieve their goals. If you're employed
    by the Space Patrol and they send you on missions, or if you suffer
    from fatigue if you spend more than two hours under normal Earth gravity
    because you were raised in space, that's a Complication. Choose Complications
    that will provide conflict for your character, or make the conflicts
    that much more interesting. Most characters pick one major and two
    minor complications; characters using the Crew template have the option
    of picking 4 minor complications instead.

6.  **Flesh out your character.** Now add colorful details that make
    your character more lifelike. There are a few mechanical decisions
    to be made here, but mostly this is you thinking through what your
    character's life is really like. For example, is your character affiliated
    with any organization or alliance of similar characters, e.g., Star
    Fleet or the Space Patrol? If so, what is their role in the organization?
    Give your character some back-story, and think about her day-to-day
    life. What causes her to brave dangers and the unknown, rather than
    holding down a safe unadventurous job? (Assuming such jobs exist in
    the campaign setting; in a post-apocalyptic world every day might
    be a struggle for survival no matter who you are.) Write down the
    basic motivation as a Drive. Think about your character's appearance.
    How does your character appear to others? What image do they project?
    Write down a short description. If you are artistic, you could even
    draw a picture of your character, or find a suitable image on the
    Internet.

### Schrödinger's Character Creation

You can actually start play with nothing but a character concept,
and defer describing abilities and assigning numbers to them until
specific abilities are needed. Pick one of the Templates or one of
the sample characters, so that you know what the numbers for various
abilities will start at. Then, each time you want to do something
that calls for a roll and that isn't covered by one of the Abilities
you've already assigned, assign an ability on the spot that covers
it, writing over one of the abilities of the Template or sample character.
If you're using a Template, don't forget you can also assign the starting
Boosts as you go if you want a number to be higher or more abilities
than just the starting ones.

Concept
-------

While there are no fixed rules for picking a character concept, there
are a few issues to think about when considering a possible character.
A good way to generate a character concept is to modify a fictional
character you enjoy. But not every character that's fun to see or
read about is fun to play. Some issues to think about are:

-   Does the character fit the tone of the game? Playing a pure comic
    relief character in a very serious game, or a melodramatic character
    in a light-hearted game, can grow old quickly.

-   Does the character have a distinctive personality? Would the other
    players be able to tell the difference between you playing this character
    and you playing other characters?

-   Does the character play well with others? Usually, you'll be playing
    as part of a team. Depending on the tone of the setting, characters
    often have dark secrets, personality flaws, and secret agendas that
    conflict with other characters. Sometimes they're just not very nice,
    to each other or to the rest of the world. But you can be a nasty
    person and still a team player. On the Firefly, characters like Jane
    or Book are often shown in conflict with the rest of the gang. But
    they still function as valuable members of the group. As long as tension
    creates interplay between the PCs, it is good. It is only when it
    blocks interaction that it's a problem. On the other hand, goody-goody
    characters that everyone likes might actually be bad for interesting
    team play. Will your character have interesting, distinctive relationships
    with the other PCs, having both friends and rivals on the team? A
    team player character contributes to group goals, but doesn't overwhelm
    everyone else's contribution. Think about typical scenes featuring
    your character. Where would others fit in? If your character is always
    alone in these scenes, always the star, or always on the sidelines,
    you might want to revise the character.

-   How does the character contribute to different kinds of group activities?
    Science Fiction will tend to have a different balance of activities
    than many other genres such as high fantasy or super-heroics. About
    equal time will usually be spent in investigation (including scientific
    research and fiddling with equipment), negotiation and interacting
    with NPCs, and combat. Try to make sure that your character has a
    role to play in all of these.

    In SF you are often up against the totally unknown. Investigation
    and research is a large part of the game, uncovering what you are
    dealing with, whether it's a being or a natural phenomenon, whether
    you must fight it, bypass it, or even incorporate it into your plans
    in order to achieve your goals and how you might do that. Zap! is
    very flexible, and you don't have to be a scientist, detective, or
    telepath to help in investigations. Maybe you know a lot of people.
    Maybe you have good transportation or unusual senses. Maybe you just
    intimidate people into divulging the key information.

    Not every being you encounter will be a foe, nor will every foe be
    defeat-able. Negotiation is about identifying and agreeing on common
    interests with beings that are suspicious of you. This is particularly
    important when dealing with representatives of larger groups, such
    as alien races or organizations. Brute force might escalate until
    the whole organization is up against your group. Again, you don't
    have to be a trained diplomat to contribute to negotiations. Maybe
    you are politically connected yourself, or maybe you can offer your
    unique services as a bargaining chip.

    Finally, combat is about kicking enemy butt. Zap!'s flexibility means
    that you can contribute to your group's combat success in a host of
    ways, not just as Mobile Infantry or with psychic powers. Your mundane
    character's attitude might make more of a difference than the bad-ass's
    big guns. If you can think of ways to combine your abilities with
    others', you can supplement their combat power. This can be as simple
    as distracting a foe while they attack. You can also help by assisting
    teammates to recover from attacks.

-   How well can you portray this character? Sometimes a character that
    you love to watch isn't a character that you want to play. If it's
    important that your character is alien, can you give it alien beliefs
    and desires, at least from time to time so that it's more than just
    a human with a bumpy forehead? Can you be as nasty as your PC, or
    are you a softy at heart? Do you really want to brood all the time,
    or do you burst if you can't crack wise?

Filling In The Templates
------------------------

### The Templates

All Templates start with 3 Boosts to spend, plus any Bonus Boosts.
Bonus Boosts don't count towards the character's starting Boosts when
it comes to calculating XP necessary to earn a new Boost.

**Crew** Crew have no super-science or psychic abilities or specialized
combat training, just courage, skill, and subtlety. They are often
the main focus of SF settings, sitting in the command chair, exploring
new worlds, and generally running the show.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Defense Power**: One "defense" power @ 6. Active or automatic
(choose one). Examples: Keep 'em Talking, Force Shield, Great Reflexes.

**Combat Skill**: One power @ 4

**Shticks**: 6 Shticks @ 5

**New Powers** begin @ 4 **New Shticks** begin @ 5

**Bad-ass** The Bad-ass might have innate super science or psychic
abilities, a signature piece of equipment like powered armor, or just
specialized training and weapons that can threaten even powerful alien
menaces.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 3, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Powers**: Three powers @ 5. Typically, an offensive skill or
weapon, a defensive skill or device, and some other power such as
a movement power.

**Shticks**: 4 Shticks @ 4

**Bonus Boost**: You have one extra Boost to spend. This does
not add to your base number of Boosts (for experience purposes).

**New powers** begin @ 5 **New Shticks** begin @ 4

**Scientist** You are trained in the science of the setting,
including the principles of super science that go beyond what is currently
known. While there is little you absolutely cannot do in extending
and applying the known science of the setting, you are at your strongest
when you combine your scientific abilities with specific knowledge
of the problems you are attempting to solve.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 3, Actions: 2

**Science! power**: Choose one of three possibilities:

-   Science! power @ 5 (d6, d4), (AA) Ultra-flexible, (A) Power-up to
    7 (d8, d6) with 3 research successes (self or others);

-   Science! power @ 6 (d6, d6), (A) Flexible, (A) Power-up to 7 (d8,
    d6), and Ultra-flexible with 3 research scenes.

-   Science! power @ 7 (d8, d6), (A) Power-up to Ultra-flexible with 3
    research scenes.

For all choices, you get the Power-up by announcing that you are researching
a device for a specific circumstances.

**Gadget defense**: A scientific gadget defense power @ 4. (A)
Flexible. Choose whether Active or Automatic.

**Shticks**: Choose 2 Shticks @ 4, plus Scientific Research @
5.

**Restriction**: Pick a Restriction that is tied in with your
brand of Science! Do you need DNA samples to analyze? Are you a roboticist,
with not even rudimentary knowledge of biology? Must you do all your
research in your own lab with its specialized equipment? You should
design your restriction so that it gives your approach to Science
a unique flavor, and makes it seem less like a magical power where
anything is possible.

**New Powers** begin @ 5 **New Shticks** begin @ 4

**Unique** You are one of a rare kind of being, possibly alien
or robotic. Perhaps you are the only one. Perhaps you are a version
of a standard creature, but somehow made unique by a freak event,
such as an alien raised by humans and with a thoroughly human outlook
on life despite looking vastly different or having bizarre powers,
or a robot who unlike others of its kind has become sentient or has
been freed from the Three Laws of Robotics (if those are a feature
of the setting).

:    

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Powers**: 2 powers @ 6 (d6,d6).

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4, d2).

**Bonus Boosts**: Add three bonus Boosts. These do not add to
base Boosts for the purpose of experience.

**Restriction**: Pick any restriction.

**New Powers** begin @ 6 **New Shticks** begin @ 3

### Aliens in Zap!

There are several different approaches you could take to playing an
alien character in Zap! You could make your alien race a Shtick or
a Power, use the Unique Template, or use an entirely new Template
specific to that alien race in the setting. Which approach you use
depends on how much your character concept focuses on being a representative
member of that alien race vs. it being background flavor while other
aspects of your character such as chosen profession take center stage.
Two players might both be members of the same alien race and take
different approaches to designing their characters depending on what
they want to emphasize. One might choose to be the ship's security
officer, choosing the Bad-ass Template and making his membership in
his proud warrior race, the Klangons, just one of his four Shticks;
the other might make his alien status central to his character concept
by using the Klangon Template devised by the GM and relegating his
status as captain of the ship's marines to one of that Template's
slots for Shticks.

Here's an alien character template. Other examples of templates for
typical SF creatures are found in Section [8](#alientemplates){reference-type="ref" reference="alientemplates"}.
Before using an SF creature template ask your GM if that creature
is allowed as a PC and whether the GM has altered the template for
her setting. The GM may also have created new SF creature templates
for the setting, so ask about other possibilities. (The rules for
creating new templates are in the section on ,
in Part III.)\

**Alien Template**

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**: 3 Powers **@** 6 (d6, d6) If suitable, you can
add Advantages and Disadvantages to each power. Each small advantage
decreases the level 1, big by 2, small Disadvantages increase it 1,
big Disadvantages increase by 2.

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)
if they fit the stereotype

**New Powers:** Start at 6 if they fit the stereotype, 4 otherwise.
For example, Mind Meld be an optional Space-Elf power. It won't be
part of the starting template, but if the player adds it, it starts
at 6 rather than 4.

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise

**Restrictions**: Any number of restrictions. Pool similar or
minor restrictions together.

**Power Boosts**: For each restriction, add one power @ 6 to
the template, increase one attribute 1, or increase one power by 1.

### Describing Abilities {#sec:DescribingPowers}

Once you've picked a Template, you fill
out the Template with specific Abilities (Powers and Shticks) according
to your concept. You give each ability slot in the template a name,
and a brief description. Although they don't change the mechanics
of using the abilities this free-form description really determines
what the ability is. Throughout the game you'll be able to use the
ability precisely when the game situation matches the description.
While some abilities might seem more limited than others, the challenge
is to provide creative justifications for the ability being useful.
So, for example, if your power is Strength it cannot be used directly
at a distance. This doesn't need to be spelled out or compensated
for; it's implicit in the notion of physical strength. But that doesn't
mean that you can never use the power in a ranged attack, just that
you need to use it indirectly. You can say you are using your Strength
to pick up a large object and hurl it at your foe, or to cause the
building they are in to collapse by knocking away a support beam,
or to intimidate them by a display of violence. In any of these ways
you use your Strength you resolve your degree of success using the
same mechanics and the same dice. Your free-form descriptions tell
you when and how you can use your abilities. Then the mechanics indicate
whether you succeed and by how much.

#### Powers vs. Shticks

Abilities come in two forms: Powers and Shticks. Anything that can
be used to attack and defend in combat is a Power, even if it may
have other uses. Anything that can't typically be used to hurt somebody
or defend yourself against being hurt is a Shtick. The same sort of
Ability might be a Power for one character and a Shtick for another,
depending on how the player sees themselves using the Ability in the
game.

While the name Powers suggests superhuman abilities, in Zap! Powers
are a generic term for *any* kind of Ability that can be used
to attack or defend against attacks. So training with a gun is a Power,
as is the Ability to lie convincingly, since it can be used to prevent
an enemy from attacking you. On the other hand, maybe your Ability
to empathically "discern lies" is a Shtick, rather than a Power,
since it would almost never be used to attack or defend in combat.
Even something like Computer Programming, which would normally be
a Shtick that takes minutes or hours to use effectively could be a
Power if you envision it being fast and effective enough to, say,
seize control of robots as they're attacking you and have them fight
on your side instead. Note that sometimes the Primary Rule would imply
that a Shtick could be used to defend yourself. E.g. if a creature
had a Power to create illusions that it uses to lure people into danger,
an Ability to "Empathically Discern Lies" would be a plausible
defense, even if it had been characterized as a Shtick.

Powers can also be used outside of combat. For example, you could
have "Keen Sense of Smell" as a Power or a Shtick. Either way,
you could use the Ability to sniff out drugs in a locker or track
someone through the woods, but you can only use it directly to give
you a defense against an invisible attacker if it is a Power.

#### Customizing Abilities

You can customize your abilities with ,
however the main thing that makes your abilities unique is the free-form
description, and you don't need to spell out the consequences in terms
of any mechanics. If your Power is Flame Blast, then it goes without
saying that this power doesn't work in water or in a vacuum, and it
might be dangerous to use in a zeppelin. On the other hand, it also
goes without saying that you can also use the Power to light up a
dark room or to provide warmth if the party is caught in a blizzard.

If you described your Power as Psychic Flames instead of physical
flames, and specify that it creates an illusion in enemies minds that
convinces them they're burning, then although it will usually work
just like a Flame Blast, there's no reason it shouldn't work under
water. You likely won't be able to light things on fire with it, or
light up a room, but physical armor would probably provide no defense.
All of these advantages and disadvantages are implicit in the description,
and do not need to be "bought."

If a Power has an especially wide range of applications, particularly
if you can use it not only as an attack and defense, but also to move
things around, manipulate them, influence their actions and so forth
you should take the FlexibleAdvantage
on the Power. If the Power is so versatile that it's easier to list
what you cannot use it for than what you can, such as for something
like Psionics, then the Ultra-Flexible Advantage
applies.

In addition there are two mechanical variations on Powers that are
neither Advantages or Disadvantages: Movement Powers and Automatic
Powers.

#### Movement powers

Movement Powers primarily let you move around. They may also be used
to attack or defend when that makes sense, e.g., using fly to ram
into a foe, or super speed to dodge bullets. Movement Powers do not
take an Action to use if they are used for movement; if you use them
for anything else they take an Action and only get to roll one die
(the larger die). Like any other power, you cannot use it more than
once a round, so you cannot use a Movement power both to move and
attack or defend. Without a Movement power you can still move in combat,
but it will take an Action to move any significant distance, and you'll
be at a disadvantage if you're trying to move while anything else
is interfering with it, such as infected mutants grabbing at your
ankles or the heaving of the ship's deck making it difficult to walk.

#### Automatic powers

Automatic powers are used in response to a certain kind of action.
They can be used multiple times in a round, and do not require an
Action to use. On the other hand, they
cannot normally be used at will, unless you can force the trigger
condition to be met. What those conditions are and what the Power
does (whether it's an attack, a defense, or movement) should be clear
from the description. An Automatic Power must be either for Attack
or Defense, not both, and to
have an attack be automatic is an Advantage. For instance, Armor could
be an automatic Defense that would be used whenever you were physically
attacked. Flame Body could be automatic Attack that would be used
whenever you were grabbed. Automatic Defenses defend against every
appropriate incoming attack, automatic Offenses attack everyone who
meets the proper conditions. If using a Power triggers an Automatic
Power, the Automatic Power Combines
with the first Power, giving it a +1. For example, if you use your
Super-Strength to grab someone, your Flame Body automatic attack would
always combine with it. You roll the dice for Super-Strength, but
add 1 to the result for the Flame Body. If you use Super-Strength
to throw something at someone, Flame Body wouldn't apply, so you would
get no bonus. Automatic Defenses cannot be hindered or disabled unless
they have the Can Be Hindered Disadvantage.

#### What Counts as a Power?

There are often several possible ways to divide your abilities up
into powers. If you can psionically cause people to sleep, find you
persuasive, or become confused, do you want these to be three separate
powers or one power called Telempathy? If you have a suit of Powered
Armor that increases your strength, provides you protection and life
support, and has mini-missiles one the shoulders and a blaster built
into the chest, you could have one Power "Powered Armor" or five
separate Powers your armor gives you. The difference is that with
the first option you could use at most one of your armor's powers
each round, but with the second you could potentially use your armor
in five different ways each round (if you have enough Actions).

You do not need to purchase Powers that are for "color" rather
than for combat advantage. Your character can turn televisions or
lights on and off with a glance without a special power. Only buy
it as a Power instead of a Shtick if you plan to be able to use it
to harm or defend against a foe, possibly by distracting them (e.g.
"Keep 'Em Talking" is a perfectly viable automatic defense, though
the Primary Rule would imply it could only be used against things
that understand your language). If the Power you have in mind isn't
actually directly useful in combat, it is probably better to treat
it as color and not list it as a power. For example, a werewolf can
change into a wolf, but what makes that useful is that the wolf form
has claws and fangs, a superior sense of smell, and regenerates. On
the other hand, you cannot go through life as a wolf, because it's
hard to turn doorknobs. So you don't have to list "Shift into wolf
form" as a power; instead, "Only usable in wolf form" would
be minor Disadvantages on some of your
powers, such as "Claws and Fangs".

It is assumed that given enough time and resources, without distractions
or opposition, a Scientist can do pretty much anything the setting's
science will allow. If you are not a scientist, you know one you can
bribe, beguile, seduce, or intimidate. So you can accomplish all kinds
of stuff in downtime without needing a separate power listed on your
sheet. If the setting's technology allows you to regrow somebody's
full body as long as you save the head, you don't have to list that
as a Power, you just have to justify how you manage to get access
to the appropriate facilities to repair your injured companions. Just
make sure your descriptions of your downtime activities are consistent
with your character concept. Your downtime activities will also be
fodder for GM plots, so abuse of this rule will often backfire on
you.

#### What Counts as a Shtick?

Anything that cannot plausibly be used on its own for attacking or
defending is a Shtick. Many Shticks are used to do research and gather
information, to operate and repair equipment, to influence other characters
in social situations, or to enhance Powers in combat.

Note that Shticks can be used in Combination with Powers to attack
or defend, as long as it makes sense according to the Primary Rule,
e.g. you can Combine your "Keen Sense of Smell" Shtick with your
"Catlike Reflexes" Power to give yourself a better chance against
an invisible attacker.

Under unusual circumstances the Primary Rule may dictate that a Shtick
actually be used directly to attack or defend; usually this is the
result of the target having a Restriction or Complication that makes
this possible. If a creature has the Restriction "Ultra-sensitive
hearing, can be hurt by high pitched noises" then a Shtick such
as Opera Singer could be used as an attack by describing how you sing
an E above high C.

### Mechanics for Abilities

Each power has a numerical rating, which determines two dice to roll
when using your Ability. Sometimes there is also a fixed number to
add in to one or both dice. When you use your Ability, you roll both
kinds of dice, and add in the modifier if any. You take the higher
of the two as your result. If the Ability is opposing another character's
Ability, they do the same, and the bigger value is the one who succeeds;
the difference determines how big the success was. If someone succeeds
on an attack against you, you are usually Hindered. That means that
you only roll the larger die when you use a power, until you or someone
else takes an action to free you from the hindering effect. The table
describes what dice correspond to what power levels.

You only roll an uncontested Ability if it is not absolutely clear
that you could use the Ability for that purpose, or if you have reason
to care whether it takes several tries or extra time and effort to
succeed; if you have all the time in the world, just assume that you
would get the maximum that you could roll on the dice and go from
there.

Roll the two dice listed and take the higher result. In Zap! you
never add the dice together.

   **PL**  Dice         **PL**  Dice
  -------- ----------- -------- ----------------
   **2**   1 point      **13**  d8+5, d12
   **3**   single d4    **14**  d8+5, d8+5
   **4**   d4, d4       **15**  d10+5, d8+5
   **5**                **16**  d10+5, d10+5
   **6**   d6, d6       **17**  d12+5, d10+5
   **7**   d8, d6       **18**  d12+5, d12+5
   **8**   d8, d8       **19**  d8+10, d12+5
   **9**   d10, d8      **20**  d8+10, d8+10
   **10**  d10, d10     **21**  d10+10, d8+10
   **11**  d12, d10     **22**  d10+10, d10+10
   **12**  d12, d12     **23**  d12+10, d10+10

Note that the Power Levels follow an easy to remember
pattern up to 12. At even levels you use two dice of the same size,
and that size matches the level (Power Level 4 is d4, d4; Power Level
6 is d6, d6; Power Level 8 is d8, d8\...). Odd levels have one die
of the next higher level and one of the next lower (Power Level 5
is a d6 and a d4, Power Level 7 is a d8 and a d6, Power Level 9 is
a d10 and a d8\...). It gets a tiny bit trickier once you get past
d12: past d12 the dice go d8+5, d10+5, d12+5, d8+10, d10+10, and so
on. However, since at any given Scope the Powers and Shticks begin
at around PL 4-6, it will be quite a while before that becomes an
issue.

### Research[\[sec:Research\]]{#sec:Research label="sec:Research"}

The Scientist's Science! Power is slightly special,
in that it starts off as a slightly weaker power and can be upgraded
during the course of an adventure by doing Research into the nature
of whatever the PCs are facing in order to tailor the power specifically
to what's currently necessary. There are three variations:

-   Starting with an Ultra-Flexible power that can do most anything but
    is at low level and can Power Up through Research to a higher level;

-   Starting with a high level Power that has one specific use and can
    Power Up to Ultra-Flexible;

-   Starting with medium power and flexibility that can Power Up to full
    power and Ultra-Flexible.

In all three variations, the procedure for doing Research remains
the same: you must, over the course of the adventure, engage in **three**
separate scenes that revolve around your character and your allies
doing the necessary Research into the device or scientific principle
you're trying to create, using your Research Shtick. In most cases
the Research Shtick
should work without a roll. If a roll
is required because the player is unsure whether their type of science
really can accomplish what they're aiming to do (say a neuroscientist
whose powers operate on brains is trying to research a device to deactivate
a robot), the GM should assign a difficulty based on the power level
of the target; if the roll fails, the Scientist can't try again in
that scene, and will have to come up with some other approach to moving
the research forward or a different sort of device.

For instance, you might have a scene where you and possibly your allies
are using the ship's computer records to identify the creature attacking
the colonists; a scene where you go to the mine where the colonists
were attacked to recover alien tissues that the device requires; and
a scene where you use the ship's lab and that tissue to create a device
capable of paralyzing the creature. The exact nature of the scenes
should be determined during play, through the players and GM deciding
what's plausible given what's been going on so far, rather than a
cookie-cutter approach: computer library, tissue, lab. It's justifying
what your character is doing as an occasion to employ the Research
Shtick; the requirement that there be three such scenes and that the
scenes be different is just to prevent every adventure from turning
into a wait while the Scientist character hangs around in the ship's
lab until the device is ready.

When you perform three successful scenes in which you are doing research
(scenes where the focus is research and you score a success with your
Research Shtick if necessary), your device is ready, and you announce
what it does. It should be one very specific effect, such as "Shrink
giant insects" or "paralyze methane-breathing creatures." While
you should be researching during this time, that doesn't mean you
can't participate in scenes. You can put down your tools and zap the
creature attacking you in the lab, or go out to the scene of the crime
and collect scientific samples.

If you decide a roll ought to be required other PCs can assist you
by using their investigative abilities to perform relevant research.
The difficulty is set to be the base power level of the intended target.

### Advantages And Disadvantages {#sec:AdvantagesAndDisadvantages}

Advantages are aspects that make a Ability more useful, and Disadvantages
are things that makes it less useful. For instance if a Ability is
exceptionally Flexible so that almost anything can be justified according
to the Primary Rule, that's an Advantage; if a Ability has a more
limited use than normal, for instance it can only be used to defend
against cold-based attacks, that's a Disadvantage. There are both
Big and Small Advantages and Disadvantages (labeled AA and A, or DD
and D), and their effects on a Ability are cumulative. A Small Advantage
on a Ability costs one Boost, a Big Advantage costs 2, a Small Disadvantage
gives you an extra Boost to spend on that Ability, and a Big Disadvantage
gives you two extra Boosts on that Ability (you may not take a Disadvantage
on a Ability in order to get Boosts to spend on some other Ability
or Attribute).

### Advantages: {#sec:Advantages}

Advantages represent some quality of the Ability that makes it more
useful. You should only give the Ability an advantage if it represents
a significant increase in the Ability. Many little side effects that
might be advantageous under some circumstances are already covered
by the description. For instance, if you have a Sleep Gas Ability
it isn't necessary to take Exotic even though it's implied that something
like a Shield or Tough Hide wouldn't be useful as a defense. Other
fairly common Abilities like Life Support or Immunity to Poison would
clearly stop the Ability altogether, while still others would depend
on how they were described as being used (e.g., using Reflexes to
jump out of the way, or Control Wind to blow it away) and so would
get to roll for defense. Exotic would be required for something like
Psionic Assault, or Time stop, since it's quite difficult to reason
through whether it's at all plausible for Reflexes or Magic Shield
to interfere. Note that this depends largely on how you choose to
define the Ability: if you define it so that Psionic Assault would
have to roll against so simple a thing as dodging with Reflexes or
Acrobatics, or be completely negated by Armor or Rocky Hide, then
you wouldn't need to justify it with the Exotic Advantage. (AA) indicates
a Big Advantage; (A) a Small Advantage.

Area Effect (AA)

:   The Ability affects all targets (friend or
    foe) in an area at full power, without needing to split it. Number
    of targets at the same Scope affected is the result on the lower die,
    times two for each Scope level lower.

Area Effect, lesser (A)

:   The Ability affects one chosen target
    at full power, and some additional nearby targets (friend or foe)
    at reduced power (result of the lower die). Number affected is the
    result of the lower die.

Bare Handed (A)

:   The Ability doesn't require any equipment as
    part of its narration; it gets both dice regardless.

Control (AA)

:   a Knock Out with this Power will allow you to control
    the actions of the target until the Knock Out is broken, at the cost
    of 1 Action per Round. Merely Hindering
    the target with a Control Power will let you force the target to take
    a single Action in the target's Turn; this will use one of the target's
    Actions and one of the target's Abilities (if required) before the
    target regains control; if the target is Hindered by some previous
    attack, he or she will not break free of the Hindrance first unless
    that's the command, instead the Action commanded will be taken while
    still Hindered.

Delayed (A)

:   the effect of the Ability doesn't occur until either
    a specified event or a certain amount of time has elapsed. You could
    use this Advantage to create a bomb, or set a trip-wire, or use a
    Power with the Control Advantage to give somebody a post-hypnotic
    suggestion (though in the latter case you would need the Subtle Advantage
    as well or the target would know about it).

Exotic[ ]{.medium}(AA)

:   An Exotic attack can't be defended against
    by ordinary Abilities, so targets use the Default Skill instead. E.g.,
    A mystic curse or psychic bolt can't be usually be stopped by armor
    or a force-field. Exotic attacks must define a fairly broad class
    of circumstances that automatically negate them (e.g., any magical
    defense, any unusual metabolism, Abilities being based on technology,
    being a non-magical creature, etc). In addition, Defenses which are
    Flexible or Ultra-Flexible should get their normal roll unless there's
    clearly no way they could help. Things like poison gas or blinding
    flashes of light are not Exotic, in and of themselves, because ordinary
    Powers or even Shticks (such as having Life Support built into your
    suit, or Lightning Reflexes to close your eyes) could justify a defense
    roll if they don't negate the Power completely. You may have only
    one Exotic Power, unless all your Exotic Powers are negated by the
    same circumstances.

Flexible (A)

:   The Ability can justify a wide range of effects
    (e.g., electromagnetic powers). Whether a Ability should be counted
    as Flexible or not is up to the player; generally a Power that's mostly
    used for attacking or defending, with occasional use for extra things
    that directly follow from its nature (such as a lightning bolt short-circuiting
    electronics) doesn't need the Flexible Advantage even if it can take
    many forms, such as a lightning bolt, a ball of lightning, grabbing
    someone to shock them, and so on; a Ability that's intended to be
    used to do many things beside simple attack and defense, such as picking
    up objects, holding things, fencing them off, gathering or concealing
    information, and the like should be given the Flexible Advantage.

Larger Scope (AA)

:   The Ability operates one Scope higher than
    normal; this doesn't change the Power Level, even when used versus
    targets at the normal Scope, it merely changes the interpretation
    of the Ability in terms of things like weight, speed, area, range,
    etc.

Ultra-Flexible (AA)

:   The Ability can justify almost any effect
    (e.g., Sorcery); you must still choose some things that are beyond
    its capabilities. Ultra-Flexible is like Flexible, but with even more
    applications. Where a Flexible Power might be one that can pick up
    or push things in addition to attack and defense, or can create an
    illusion in addition to attack and defense, an Ultra-Flexible Power
    is one that could do all those and more. A typical Ultra-Flexible
    Power is one where it is harder to think of things that it shouldn't
    be permitted to do rather than things that it should.

Persistent (AA)

:   The Ability will remain in effect as long as
    you spend your entire turn maintaining it, and no external force interferes.

Power-up (A)

:   The power level can be increased, under some circumstances,
    or at a cost or risk. Pick a Large Disadvantage, and a way of spending
    two Boosts on the Ability (e.g., +2 power level, one Large Advantage,
    2 Small Advantages, or +1 level and a Small Advantage) The Ability
    can be used at the higher level if the character takes the Disadvantage
    for that use. If the Disadvantage affects future uses of the Ability,
    e..g, Burnout, it affects the entire Ability, not just the power-up.
    It must be a Disadvantage that makes sense for a single use.

Subtle (A)

:   It's not obvious that the Ability is being used,
    unless you have a Ability that grants you appropriate senses. Telepathy
    or Mind Control are typical Abilities that benefit from this Advantage,
    but it could apply to something more prosaic, like an invisible Sleep
    gas.

### Disadvantages: {#sec:Disadvantages}

Disadvantages represent some Disadvantage that makes the Ability less
useful than the Primary Rule would otherwise allow. It is not intended
that you place Disadvantages on Abilities merely to represent the
Disadvantages that such a Ability would naturally have given the Primary
Rule. For instance, even though fire requires oxygen and can only
burn flammable materials, you wouldn't take Circumstanced Limited
to represent it not working without oxygen, or not harming things
that aren't flammable unless the intent was to make it even more vulnerable
to those circumstances than you would assume such as requiring high
concentrations of oxygen as from a tank of compressed oxygen, or only
capable of damaging things at all if they are as easily combustible
as, say, paper.

(DD) indicates a Big Disadvantage; (D) is a Small Disadvantage.

Absorption (D)

:   The Ability must be used as a defense each time
    before it can be used for any other purposes; in other words you must
    use it to absorb an incoming attack in order to "Power it up."

Automatic Can Be Hindered (DD)

:   automatic defenses are normally
    not affected by Hindering
    or Disabling, but this Power is. Reduce it to one die when you are
    Hindered.

Burn Out (DD)

:   If you roll doubles the Ability works this time
    but burns out and can't be used again; restoring the Ability can only
    be done by application of some suitable other Ability or being out
    of combat for three Turns (e.g., by using Gadgeteering to fix Powered
    Armor, or by returning to your base to repair it). If the Ability
    is reduced to a single die for some reason, such as being Hindered,
    roll that single die for the result, then roll the second die to see
    if it burns out.

Combination Difficult (D)

:   Cannot be combined with your own
    Abilities.

Combination Impossible (DD)

:   Cannot be combined with any other
    Abilities.

Delayed (D)

:   The Ability goes off one turn after the Action is
    spent.

Disabling Only (DD)

:   The Power can only be used to Disable other
    Powers (e.g., a Power that drained mutant powers).

Easily Disabled (D)

:   The Ability is easy to disable; when targeted,
    it defends itself with only one die. Captain Patriot's shield is easier
    to take away or interfere with than the Living Flame's Fire Blasts,
    so he takes it as Easily Disabled.

Equipment Required (D)

:   The Ability cannot operate without equipment,
    e.g. Wormhole Navigation, assuming you need a computer to do the calculations.

Automatic Can be Disabled (D)

:   automatic defenses normally
    are only reduced to a single die when Disabled (how do you render
    somebody's rocky skin completely ineffective?), but this Power can
    be interfered with as if it were a Regular Power instead; e.g., if
    Captain Patriot took his Shield as a automatic Defense (so he can
    use it to defend without having to spend an Action), ordinarily attackers
    couldn't totally Disable it at all. Since that doesn't make complete
    sense (if they physically take it away, how would he still defend
    with it?) he takes as automatic Can be Disabled meaning when somebody
    can Disable it as if it were a Regular Power. automatics that Can
    Be Disabled still roll both dice to resist.

Erratic (D)

:   The Ability does nothing when you roll a Mishap.

Fragile (D)

:   The Ability is hard to repair once disabled; when
    an attempt is made to disable it, a Hinder
    counts as Out, and Out means that the Ability can't be repaired without
    spending hours outside of combat, possibly at a base or lab with special
    tools.

Ultra-Fragile (DD)

:   The Ability is so hard to repair once disabled
    that when an attempt is made to disable it, a Hinder
    counts as the Ability being unable to be repaired without spending
    hours outside of combat, and Out means the Ability can't be repaired
    except by going on an adventure to restore it, or spending 1 XP.

Limited (D)

:   The Ability can only be used when certain conditions
    are met, which should occur about half the time or when you can't
    control the circumstances. E.g., a Ability that only works when you
    have both hands free, or a automatic Defense that only works against
    impact attacks (being punched, hit with flying buildings, and so on,
    but not lasers, fire, and the like).

Very Limited (DD)

:   The Ability can only be used when certain
    rare conditions are met, which should occur during the occasional
    adventure and not under your control. E.g., Ability only works under
    water in a campaign set on dry land, Ability only works during a full
    moon, or a automatic Defense that only works against cold-based attacks.

Shots (D)

:   The Ability has a fixed amount of "shots" that
    gets expended; number of uses can be up to 8. The hero must take active
    steps, such as returning to base, in order to replenish it.

Side Effects (D or DD)

:   Instead of doing nothing when you
    roll a Mishap, something bad happens, such as hitting an ally, or
    yourself. The GM decides the exact effect when the roll occurs. The
    small version does something strange, but probably not dangerous.

Single-Action Defense (D)

:   when used as an active defense only
    defends against a single attack, rather than throughout the round
    as normal.

Single Use (DD)

:   The Ability can only be used once per combat.
    Replenishes automatically between combats (at least three consecutive
    Turns while not using any Actions).

Slow (D)

:   The Ability takes 2 Actions to use.

Ultra-Slow (DD)

:   The Ability takes 3 Actions to use. 

Unpredictable (DD)

:   The effect of the Ability is up to the GM,
    not the player (though it still must be beneficial).

**A Note On Flexibility** [\[sec:ANoteOnFlexibility\]]{#sec:ANoteOnFlexibility label="sec:ANoteOnFlexibility"}

Unlike some of the other Advantages, Flexible and Ultra-Flexible advantages
aren't very sharply defined. Even having a Power that represented
a variety of equivalent attacks that differ in such minor things as
whether they're melee or ranged or the exact flavor of damage, such
as being armed with a sword and a bow, or having a suit that has wrist-blasters,
laser eye-beams, and a chest cannon doesn't really make the Power
much more Flexible as long as conceptually the powers do the same
sorts of things, such as damage targets.

It's when the Ability can be either be altered on the fly or has a
number of completely distinct uses so that it can take advantage of
the Primary Rule to do a wide variety of different things that it
becomes an issue. For instance, since a sword and a gun would in general
both be straightforward attacks (kinetic energy, even) there's no
need to apply the Flexible Advantage to a Power that represents having
both. On the other hand, if your Power is a gun that can switch between
firing a laser and lifting things via gravitational force or generating
illusions of scary monsters, that probably should be given the Flexible
Advantage to make up for being able to use the Power in an especially
wide set of circumstances. Similarly if your Ability is a utility
belt that contains a bunch of different things such as handcuffs,
lock-picks, listening devices, a cutting torch, and a flash-bang grenade,
that would be represented by the Flexible Advantage.

Generally with the Flexible Advantage you should be able to define
what it does in advance, and should limit yourself to no more than
the Ability Level in different aspects at once, so the aforementioned
Utility Belt with five tricks would require PL 5. That doesn't preclude
using the Primary Rule to come up with new clever uses for, say, handcuffs,
but it should preclude suddenly discovering a new device that's just
what you need for the situation in there. If it makes sense, you are
free to change the list of what your Flexible Ability does (e.g. what
tricks you are carrying in your utility belt) between adventures,
or if you return to your base.

Ultra-Flexible Abilities, on the other hand, represent those that
have uses too numerous to list out in advance, or that can be reconfigured
"on the fly" by the hero. With a utility belt using the Ultra-Flexible
advantage, you are allowed to just "discover" that you've packed
away a can of aerosol shark-repellant for just this occasion, or (in
a more serious vein) that you have the chemicals needed to whip something
like that up on a moment's notice. With Ultra-Flexible Abilities you
should be scrupulous in defining in advance categories of things that
the Ability *cannot* do. Generally the Ultra-Flexible Ability
should have either one small restriction per PL above 6 (such as can't
affect targets with a completely inhuman metabolism) or half that
many large restrictions (such as can't affect inanimate objects, or
targets with no mind). More powerful Ultra-Flexible Abilities thus
are more restricted, but they're much more dangerous because they
can be tailored to the immediate situation.

Flexibility should *not* be used just to have a bunch of different
attacks to tailor them to bypass the target's defenses; if you wish
to have a Power that is particularly hard to defend against, take
the Exotic advantage instead, or in addition. Flexibility is meant
to give you more options in how you describe using your Power and
the tasks it can apply to, not just a straight mechanical advantage
in knocking foes out.

In any event, Flexibility has no bearing on whether a Power goes against
Toughness, Stamina, or Will: that is determined by the Primary Rule
description of how the Power is being used. A Laser Gun might be an
attack against Toughness if fired directly against a foe, against
Stamina if it were used to rupture a nearby coolant line to release
a choking cloud of gas, or even against Will if you were snapping
off shots trying to force the foes to keep under cover.

Whether to represent several different things that you can do as a
single Power with the Flexible Advantage or take several different
Powers is a matter of style. Since you can only use a Power once per
Round, if you envision using it two different ways in the same Round,
or it seems implausible to you that using say, your powered armor's
chest beam should preclude you using its life-support at the same
time, you should take the powers separately.

#### New Advantages and Disadvantages {#sec:NewAdvantagesAndDisadvantages}

The list of Advantages
and Disadvantages is not exhaustive, and you can consult with the
GM and other players about new ones you'd like to add. Before you
do, though, you should consider whether it can be handled by one of
the existing ones, some of which are quite broad, or by a Complication,
or just by applying the Primary Rule given how you imagine the Power
working. Zap! discourages min-maxing (tweaking characters to get
the maximum effectiveness for the minimum drawbacks), so before you
add a new Advantage or Disadvantage you should really consider whether
it's necessary to capture the concept of the Power and not just an
excuse to be able afford an extra Power or Advantage or to make the
Power useful out of all proportion to its Power Level. One quick test
is if you wouldn't mind if the enemies start employing the same Advantage
or Disadvantage on their Powers, it's probably okay.

### Mishaps[\[sec:Mishaps\]]{#sec:Mishaps label="sec:Mishaps"}

Some Disadvantages such as Erratic or Side-Effects only trigger when
the hero rolls a "Mishap" on an attempt to use the power. Mishaps
never occur outside the context of these Disadvantages, so most of
the time you don't have to consider it. Mishaps don't occur if the
use of the power doesn't require a roll, unless the hero has the Frequent
Mishaps Disadvantage.

If the power has such a Disadvantage then if a roll on the power comes
up **doubles**, there is a chance of a Mishap. Roll a d12 to
"confirm" whether there's a Mishap: if you roll less than or equal
to the die-size of the highest die, then a Mishap has occurred and
the Disadvantage takes effect. E.g. a PL 7 (d6, d4) power has Burn-Out
as a Disadvantage: the player rolls 3, 3 which means there's a chance
of a Mishap. She rolls a d12, and if she gets a 6 or less the power
burns out. Disadvantages that have a chance of Mishap will occur 1/12
of the time (powers rolling bigger dice have less chance of doubles,
but more chance that doubles are confirmed as a Mishap).

If a Power that can have a Mishap has been reduced to a single die,
such as when you are Hindered, instead of checking for doubles roll
a d12. On a roll of 12 a Mishap occurs.

####### Alternate Method

If players find it simpler they can roll a separate d12 Mishap die
whenever they roll a power with such a Disadvantage, and the Mishap
occurs on a roll of 12, regardless of what the other dice show. The
odds of Mishap are the same, but it requires rolling more dice since
you roll the Mishap die every time and not just when doubles come
up.

### Restrictions

Scientists and Uniques need to choose a Restriction. A fixed set of
Restrictions will be part of the templates for most alien creatures.
Restrictions should be severe enough that they could be used to definite
strategic advantage by a foe that knows about you, while not crippling
your character for play. Below are several kinds of restriction for
inspiration; this is not meant as a complete list, but suggests how
severe restrictions ought to be. You can group minor restrictions
together, especially of the same kind, to make a more serious restriction.

Addiction:

:   You need a certain unusual substance or activity to
    survive, or are compelled to seek it. If you are deprived of this
    substance, you can be distracted by its presence. This counts as being
    hindered until you obtain it or it is removed from your presence.

Alter Ego:

:   Under some circumstances, your body is taken over
    by a personality that doesn't take your wishes into account. For example,
    a human host of an alien symbiont might generally be the dominant
    personality but sometimes find the alien in control.

Aversion:

:   You find a common substance unpleasant to be around,
    e.g., a desert-world alien that hates water. You will avoid it if
    at all possible, and if suddenly presented with it, will cringe away.
    This usually takes one Action. You cannot usually be affected multiple
    times.

Block:

:   There is a common activity that you cannot do. For example,
    a cyborg might be unable to swim.

Compulsion:

:   Under some circumstance, you must do something whether
    you wish to or not. You lose control of your actions until this is
    finished. For example, a shapeshifting alien might be required to
    spend one hour out of 24 in a liquid state, unable to take any actions.

Ritual:

:   You need to undertake a daily ritual to keep your powers
    or stay healthy. If you don't get the chance to perform the ritual,
    your powers are hindered or disabled until you can do it. For instance,
    certain kinds of robots might need to recharge daily.

Susceptibility:

:   A certain substance hurts you. You are hindered
    while in its presence, and it may eventually be fatal. Example: a
    methane-breathing alien might find oxygen poisonous.

Taboo:

:   You are not permitted to do something that most people
    do. If you do it, major portions of your power will be blocked until
    the situation is remedied. E.g. A robot might be programmed to obey
    the Three Laws of Robotics, and malfunction or become catatonic if
    it ever accidentally harmed a human

Vulnerability:

:   A certain substance or kind of attack hurts you
    disproportionately. E.g. an alien with really sensitive hearing that
    is more easily hurt by sonic attacks. Your defenses against this kind
    of attack count as hindered, even the automatic ones, so you only
    roll one die for each defense.

Spending your Boosts
--------------------

You have a certain number of Boosts to spend on your character, usually
3. As you gain experience, you will be able to purchase more Boosts.
The number of XP you need to get an additional Boost is equal to your
current number of Boosts.

Each Boost can be spent for one of the following:

-   Add one to one of the four attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and
    Actions.

-   Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage. 2 Boosts
    give it a big Advantage.

-   Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.

-   Add one new power. The starting level is given in your template.

-   Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one
    Shtick at one higher level.

-   Get a companion, base, or vehicle. You can then spend additional Boosts
    to improve these.

-   Get three Assets. Assets are things like Favors, Contacts

-   You may increase an Ability by giving that Ability Disadvantages;
    a Small Disadvantage lets you increase it by 1 or give it a Small
    Advantage; a Big Disadvantage lets you: increase it by 2; add 2 Small
    Advantages; increase by 1 and add one Small Advantage; add a Big Advantage.

### Attributes {#sec:Attributes}

Boosts can be spent on increasing your Attributes. Attributes in Zap! are
characteristics that everybody has. Three of the Attributes are primarily
defensive, representing how much characters can resist various types
of Powers: Toughness, Will, and Stamina. The remaining Attribute,
Actions, is how many different things you can do in a Round. An ordinary
person has a score of 1 in each,
but player characters start with at least 2 in each. Having 3 in an
attribute would make you one of the world's toughest humans in that
respect, and a 5 or more is definitely superhuman.

#### Toughness {#sec:Toughness}

Toughness is how physically
durable you are. The higher your Toughness, the more likely you are
to avoid becoming Out (of the fight) due to most types of attack.

#### Will {#sec:Will}

Will is how mentally prepared and
determined you are. The higher your Will, the harder you are to Control
or put Out with a mental attack. You also get a bigger bonus when
making a Supreme Effort.

#### Stamina {#sec:Stamina}

Stamina is your endurance. It represents your ability to push beyond
your normal limits, as well as your resistance to certain unusual
forms of attack such as energy drains, being strangled or drowned.
The higher your Stamina, the harder you are to put Out with attacks
that weaken you, such as Energy Drain or Poison Gas. You can also
exert yourself more often by using Supreme Effort more frequently
and are less likely to be tired by invoking Failure is Not an Option!

#### Actions {#sec:Actions}

Actions is the number of distinct actions you
can take during a Round. Using an Active
Power counts as an Action even if you
don't end up rolling the dice, as does manipulating objects such as
opening a door, pressing a big red destruct button, or calling somebody
on a cell phone. For instance, if you use your Ice Mastery Power to
create a slide to catch a falling child you don't need to roll for
success, but it does still take one of your Actions for the Round.

Think of an Action as a single panel in a comic book, or a single
shot in a movie.

One thing to keep in mind is that you can only use most Powers once
per Round, and each use takes an Action; only Automatic
Powers can be used multiple times in a Round and don't cost an Action
to use. When creating your character you usually want to balance your
number of Powers with your Actions. If you have many Powers but few
Actions, you won't use most of your Powers in any one Round, although
it gives you a wide variety of Powers to pick from. If you have many
Actions but few regular Powers, many of your Actions will be spent
assisting teammates to recover or performing tasks that don't require
Powers, such as closing doors, kicking away dropped weapons, and so
on.

### Assets[\[sec:Assets\]]{#sec:Assets label="sec:Assets"}

Boosts can also be spent on Assets. Assets are things owned by your
character, such as Companions, Avatars, Vehicles, or Bases. Assets
can belong to a group rather than individual. If you are the crew
of a starship, the ship can belong to all of you. If a group shares
an Asset, they can divide up the costs arbitrarily. Each can contribute
a share of XP, including the XP needed for the first Boost needed
to purchase the Asset.

#### Companions {#sec:Companion}

Many characters in science fiction have assistants, servants, pets,
or trusted companions. Any type of creature can be a Companion, from
a flying, acid-spitting mini-dragon to a mindless android awaiting
your instructions, to a trusted friend.

One Boost gets you a Companion with all Attributes 1, three powers
at 5, and two Shticks at 4. Experience points spent on Companions
don't increase your hero's Boosts (and hence, do not increase the
XP Cost to buy future Boosts for you), but do increase Boosts a costs
for the Companion. It costs 1 XP to give your Companion 1 Boost. From
then on, it costs XP equal to the total number of Boosts your Companion
already has to give it an additional Boost. So a second XP gives it
a second Boost, then 2 more XP are required to give it a third. If
you want to give your Companions extra Boosts to start, you can trade
one of your Boosts for 3 XP and spend that on your Companion or other
Assets.

Not every friend or ally needs to be a Companion. What distinguishes
a Companion from a friend is that a Companion will obey you almost
unquestioningly, and are willing to place themselves in danger for
you.

#### Avatars[\[subsec:Avatars\]]{#subsec:Avatars label="subsec:Avatars"}

Certain kinds of Science Fiction stories, notably Cyberpunk, have
much of the activity take place in cyberspace or a virtual reality.
If this is a once-in-a-while activity in the game, it can be handled
as an ordinary Power (e.g. Hacking, Cybersystems) but if it's going
to be the basis of a lot of the action, the characters can have Avatars,
which are complete characters in their own right that exist only in
the VR/cyberspace setting. One Boost gets you an Avatar that's a complete
character, using whatever Template you choose; it need not be the
same Template as the real-world version of the character. When you
are using your Avatar in cyberspace, your "meatspace" character
is absorbed in what it's doing and gets no Actions. XP that you earn
can be spent on improving the Avatar instead in the same way that
you would improve your own character. The Avatar will interact with
objects and other Avatars in cyberspace just as characters do in the
game-world, though the way that cyberspace looks and behaves according
to the Primary Rule may vary considerably from the way the meatspace
world works; the GM and the players should take extra care to discuss
how it ought to work to avoid clashing assumptions and styles.

#### Vehicles {#sec:Vehicles}

Some characters have special Vehicles that allow
them to get to where the action is. Vehicles need not be at the same
Scope as the characters. Ones at the same Scope take the characters
from place to place within an adventure or can be used in combat scenes.
Spaceships will generally be on a completely different Scope from
the characters, and have their own Chapter on designing and using
them (see ). Vehicles can carry teammates and
cargo as well as you. You don't need a Vehicle as an Asset to have
a driver's license and car. Only purchase a Vehicle if it has special
abilities of its own, or you actually use it in a fight. A land-speeder
is just a hovercraft that takes you to the dives in the starport.
That wouldn't count as a Vehicle. But Serenity, the ship in Firefly,
is almost a character in its own right, and would certainly be bought
as a Vehicle.

You can describe your Vehicle as fitting any number of passengers,
but the larger it is, the more restricted it will be in going off-road,
landing, or docking as appropriate. You can give your Vehicle Boosts
as you would a Companion. The first Boost costs 1 XP, then the second
2, and so on. This does not count towards increasing your own Boosts.
If you trade one of your initial Boosts for 3 XP, you can thus use
this to improve your starting Vehicle by two Boosts.

Vehicles start with only Toughness as an Attribute, but you can purchase
Will and Actions. A Vehicle with 0 Actions can still use its Movement
power to move, since that costs 0 Actions. To use any other power,
or to use the Vehicles Movement to attack or defend, you would need
to use one of your own Actions. If you buy your Vehicle at least one
Action, it can perform independent actions. If it has zero Will, your
character must have trained or programmed it explicitly for these
actions. If it has a Will of at least 1, it has some kind of intelligence,
and can react to circumstances without explicit input from you.

You can also use a Boost to buy a spaceship, starting with one of
the base Ship Templates (equivalent to 10 Wealth Points); some campaigns
may be based around the players all being crew on a much more powerful
Ship, in which case the GM should just design the ship using whatever
budget seems sensible and the players need not spend any Boosts to
have it as an Asset.

#### Bases {#sec:Bases}

Characters often require a base of operations, where they can store
their equipment and mementos of their past adventures, keep their
labs and scientific equipment, and recharge their robotic bodies.
One Boost gets you an area or structure of any description, suitable
for occupation. It could be a building in an office park, a secret
asteroid base, a research compound on a private island, or perhaps
a huge warehouse in the middle of nowhere. The structure will have
Toughness 4 and other Attributes 0. It will have two Shticks at 4
usable by anyone inside, such as Research Library or First-Aid Kit.
XP can be spent to improve a base, just like for Companions and Vehicles.
You can give a base Attributes, Powers and Shticks. Powers and Shticks
are only usable inside the base, or at the perimeter, as appropriate.
If you don't give it any Actions, someone inside needs to use an Action
to trigger any non-Automatic Power. If you give it Actions but no
Will, the powers are programmable, following simple commands, and
do not require someone else to spend Actions. If you give it a positive
Will, there is some computer or other intelligence that controls the
base's powers, and can act independently.

##### Base Advantages {#sec:BaseAdvantages}

These Advantages apply only to Powers
that belong to the base, and apply to a specific Power of the base;
you can't, for instance, take the Advantage Remote-Controlled as an
advantage on the entire base and have it apply to all the Powers in
the base "for free." A base's Powers may also have Advantages
from the regular list, where appropriate.

Remote-Controlled (A)

:   Remote-Controlled Powers can be activated
    by a hero from outside the base, as long as he's still within the
    Scope; the Power would still take effect within the base (though for
    some things, like looking up records on a computer, that's not really
    a Disadvantage).

Long-Ranged (AA)

:   Long-Ranged Powers can be operated from within
    the base but targeted at things outside of the base, as long as they're
    still in-Scope. Powers would also need the Remote-Controlled advantage
    to be operated from outside of the base to target something outside
    of the base, e.g., a Teleporter that a hero could use to travel to
    the base.

Larger Scope (AA)

:   Larger Scope Powers can operate at a Scope
    above that of the base; this advantage can be taken multiple times,
    each time increasing the Power up by one level of Scope. A City-Scope
    base could thus have a scanner that could monitor an entire Region,
    or a teleporter capable of Interplanetary jumps.

#### Minor Assets {#sec:MinorAssets}

Some characters have special equipment, or perks, like security clearance
or law-enforcement authority, some have contacts in the underworld
or with the police, some are owed a big favor by somebody with unusual
resources or power, and some are well-known enough to influence people's
reactions to them for good or ill. These aren't exactly Abilities,
but they are capabilities that are similar in some ways. Minor Assets
come in several flavors: Equipment, Perks, Contacts, Favors, Wealth
and Rank. At creation a character can spend one Boost on **three**
Minor Assets appropriate to their Personal Scope. That is, if the
Personal Scope is Scope 5 (City), then their contact has City-wide
information/power/authority such as the Chief of Police or Mayor,
anchor of the local news, owner of a local company, while a National-Scope
Contact might be the President, CEO of a nation-wide corporation,
star of a nationally broadcast television program, or a Supreme Court
Justice.

Minor Assets can be adjusted up or down from the base Scope two-for-one.
So a City Contact could be traded for two Neighborhood contacts, or
four Street-level contacts; in the other direction two City Contacts
could be traded for one Regional Contact, and four could be traded
for one National Contact.

When rolling for the effect of a Minor Asset, that is where it's not
obvious from the nature of the Minor Asset and the Primary Rule whether
it would apply or be effective, roll the Asset's PL vs. a Difficulty
commensurate with the Scope. (See Difficulty for Other Tasks [\[subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks\]](#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks){reference-type="ref" reference="subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks"}.)
Minor Assets begin at PL 4 unless otherwise stated.

When spending XP, you can choose to purchase new Minor Assets, and
XP spent on Minor Assets doesn't increase your hero's Boosts. One
point of XP (not one Boost) purchases 1 Minor Asset at the current
Scope; increasing the Minor Asset's PL by 1 costs 1 *XP* for
the first increase, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and so on.

##### Equipment[\[subsec:Equipment\]]{#subsec:Equipment label="subsec:Equipment"}

Characters can begin with equipment appropriate to their Abilities
for free; the die-size of the Equipment is equal to the lower die
of the appropriate Power or Shtick, so this would be helpful in narrating
what they can do, but wouldn't actually increase the roll. E.g. if
the character has a power Photon Sword at PL 5, then a d4 Photon Sword
would be free (since PL 5 rolls a d6 and a d4); if the PL had been
6, then the Photon Sword would start at 6. Spending 1 XP increases
the *die-size* by one, 2 XP to increase it again, and so on;
thus for one Boost (3 XP), that could become a d8 Photon Sword. See
for a full discussion of Equipment.

##### Perks {#sec:Perks}

A Perk is a special dispensation or benefit that comes from the role
the character plays in the community or with an organization. For
instance, a character might be deputized by the local police force,
allowing him to make legally sanctioned arrests, but requiring him
to follow the same rules as to probable cause and evidence that the
police follow. Another character might have security clearance with
the Federal Government, or even a far-flung stellar empire. The effects
and restrictions for having a Perk are worked out through the Primary
Rule, though the GM might call for a roll of the Perk against the
Difficulty if there's some doubt as to whether the requested use is
truly sanctioned by the Perk.

##### Contacts {#sec:Contacts}

A Contact is somebody with access to information or authority who
can prove useful to the character. A contact might be a snitch in
the local underworld, a pal in the Star Knight records department,
the head of Interstellar Security Service, and so on, depending on
the Scope. Contacts will cooperate with the character in areas that
are within their competency and authority, but won't risk their lives
or their careers to help. Contacts might also call upon the character
to reciprocate. The effects and restrictions for having a Contact
are worked out through the Primary Rule, though the GM might call
for a roll of the Contact's PL vs. the Difficulty if there's some
doubt as to whether the contact really has the information or authority
needed. You don't need a separate roll to see if the Contact will
help; the roll of the Contact's PL vs. the Difficulty covers that:
failure could indicate the Contact won't help or can't help, depending
on the Primary Rule.

A Contact that would readily risk life and career to help the character
should be taken as if it were a Companion, even if the contact would
almost never accompany the character on an adventure.

##### Favors {#sec:Favors}

A Favor is something big that somebody owes the character--big enough
that they might actually risk their life or career to help. Favors
need not be owed to the character by Contacts or friends: the local
gang lord might owe the hero a debt of honor for saving the gang lord's
daughter's life, for instance. Favors can only be called in once,
and then are gone. You don't usually need to roll to see if the person
who owes you the favor will cooperate, but the GM might roll as with
Contacts above if there's some doubt whether the favor being asked
for is actually within the debtor's power to grant; if there's some
reason that the person isn't actually in the position to grant the
favor, the favor isn't used up.

##### Wealth[\[subsec:Wealth\]]{#subsec:Wealth label="subsec:Wealth"}

If the campaign is using the optional rules,
characters can start with Wealth as a Minor Asset. Wealth starts at
4, and can be increased like any Minor Asset (1 XP for the first increase,
2 for the second, etc.) but unlike most Minor Assets is likely to
increase or decrease during play, and not just as a result of spending
XP. If Wealth decreases during play, characters don't get any XP they
spent back. See for a full discussion of how
Wealth is used.

If you're not using the Wealth rules, or even if you are, characters
can be wealthy as part of their background or as a Shtick, but that
doesn't translate directly into buying and selling things; instead
it's handled narratively as part of the Primary Rule. I.e. a character
might justify trying to bribe her way to see the Emperor with her
Wealthy Shtick, but shouldn't just buy everybody on her ship d10 Powered
Armor by appealing to her Shtick instead of spending XP for it under
the Equipment rules.

##### Rank[\[subsec:Rank\]]{#subsec:Rank label="subsec:Rank"}

A character may have a rank within a particular organization; rank
acts much like a Contact, but it's the character's own authority that's
being exercised. The rank should be commensurate with the character's
*Adventure* Scope, rather than Personal Scope. You can be a general
without being able to fight like an army. Roll the PL in Rank vs.
the Difficulty set by the GM to determine whether your rank grants
you sufficient authority. If you roll a Mishap while pulling rank,
there should be repercussions, though the order may still be carried
out if the roll was a success.

Complications {#sec:Complications}
-------------

Every good character has things that complicate
life and add drama. It might be that in the eyes of the law, you are
a dangerous criminal, or maybe your uncle wants you to stay home and
be a moisture farmer instead of joining Star Academy. Perhaps you
are poor, and have to struggle to earn enough credits to keep your
rust-bucket starship flying. You should choose Complications to highlight
themes you want to be dealing with in the game. Complications are
invitations to the GM to focus on a particular aspect of your character
or kind of adventure you'd like to have. Every Zap! character has
roughly the same number and severity of Complications. You are perfectly
free to change your character's Complications between adventures;
if you want to stop focusing on your money problems for a while you
can tell the GM that and substitute a new Complication\...perhaps you
become the target of a local crime lord, who wants to recruit you
as a smuggler. Removing poverty as a Complication doesn't necessarily
mean that you're wealthy now, only that trying to earn enough credits
for day-to-day ship's expenses and repairs shouldn't crop up frequently
in adventures.

Most characters take one Big Complication and two Small Complications.
Crew have the option of having 4 Small Complications instead, since
their problems may be less of a character hook. A Big Complication
is something that will crop up almost all the time, and will form
one of the main themes of the character. Not every adventure will
incorporate it, but it will come as no great surprise if one does.
A Small Complication is one that only has an occasional impact, though
it might be a big deal when it does, or if it crops up frequently
it does so in a minor way. Complications can be chosen to be Big or
Small depending on your preference. As a Small Complication, being
Wanted by the Law might mean that you can't go to the police to ask
for information or assistance, and you leave your neatly-wrapped foes
for them to find, bugging out before they can arrest you too. As a
Big Complication, the police might actually try to arrest you in the
middle of a battle, or even aid your foe thinking that he must be
one of the good guys because he's fighting you!

Since Complications are a way to focus the attention on your character,
you don't want to take Complications that everyone in your group will
have, such as Hates Evil or Takes Risks.

### Note On Complications {#sec:NoteOnComplications}

Try
to avoid thinking of Complications as part of a price you have to
pay to the GM in order to play a cool alien creature or kick-ass cyborg
warrior; that can lead to picking a Complication that will annoy you
when it crops up\...but you're not playing the game in order to be
annoyed, and it's not the GM's job to keep you from having too much
fun. Ideally you should be looking forward to your Complications coming
up in an adventure, because it throws the spotlight on your hero and
gives you a chance to either have some drama or be clever and engage
in lateral thinking. Kryptonite wasn't introduced into Superman's
mythos in order to make it more fair, it was created to make it more
interesting. Having to rescue somebody from an area strewn with Kryptonite
presented a challenge that couldn't be solved by a straight application
of his awesome powers. When you choose Complications you should be
thinking in terms of what sort of problems would you like to be presented
with during play and whether those will actually be fun for you to
deal with. Don't over-think it, though; remember, in Zap! when you
get tired of a Complication you can simply set it aside and replace
it with a new one. Ultimately the goal of Complications is to help
the GM drive the game in directions that you find interesting.

Fleshing out Your Character {#sec:FinishingYourHero}
---------------------------

### Drive

Drive is a description of your character's primary motivation, what
makes her go off and explore strange new worlds and seek out new civilizations.
It could be curiosity, duty, vengeance, the desire for personal power,
protecting the innocent, or the quest for personal enlightenment.
Your Drive will help you role-play your character, and help the GM
come up with adventures that are interesting to you.

### Back-story {#sec:OriginAndBackground}

What happened before your character
decided to adventure? Did you attend an Academy that trained you?
Were you kidnapped from your home-world? Did you stow away on a starship,
seeking adventure or just an escape from the slums where you were
born? Or is it just a job to you, not an adventure at all? Who are
your family and friends? What do you do for a living? Describe the
character's back story in as much or as little detail as you like.
This is your opportunity to flesh out who your character is and what
she can do other than fight. You can add details about the character's
civilian life, profession and hobbies, friends and family, skills
and training, notable past adventures, and whatever else you think
is relevant.

Your back story need not be completely determined at the start of
play. Serial fiction is full of revelations of previously unmentioned
background details, from members of your family having been killed
decades before by this episode's villain, to the big bad actually
being your father and your love interest your sister. Players should
feel free to Retcon their character's pasts, though they should probably
clear it with the GM before they do the kind that actually contradicts
prior versions of the story, just in case the GM had built it into
the campaign in a way that would be hard to fix.

### Appearance {#sec:Appearance}

Think about what image your character projects. How will others see
her or him? Usually, your appearance is related to your true nature
in one of three ways. Your appearance could reflect your true nature
(a bad-ass who looks every bit a bad-ass), it could be adopted deliberately
to hide your true nature (a bad-ass who looks like Casper Milquetoast
because being underestimated is useful), or it could be an ironic
contrast to or statement about your true nature (the big scary-looking
alien who's poetic and sensitive).

In addition, a picture or description can help you resolve issues
when it comes to applying the Primary Rule. There will often come
times when you need to know whether your hero wears a closed helmet,
say, or gloves, or has any accessible gadgets hanging from her belt;
in these situations a picture can be worth a thousand words. Working
out such details in advance, incidental to designing your hero's appearance,
can speed play and free you from worrying about whether you're being
fair.

If you are more of a visual person, you might even want to draw or
use a computer sketch program to create an image of your character.

Alien templates {#alientemplates}
---------------

Here are some aliens suitable for PCs reminiscent
of various SF tales. Most campaigns would replace these or at least
add new ones to flesh out the setting. Aliens should be designed to
be able to work along side of humans (possibly using high technology)
or whatever the baseline sophont of the setting is, e.g. no aliens
that can only survive in an atmosphere that would be poisonous to
all the other player characters unless being trapped in an environment
suit is part of the challenge of playing that alien.

**Klangon Template**

Klangons are a race of boney-foreheaded aliens with a proud warrior
culture, a love of opera, and taste for prune juice.

**Attributes: Tough**: 4 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

Great Strength: 6 (d6, d6)

Hardiness: 6 (d6, d6) automatic defense

Combat Training: 6 Klangons are trained almost from birth in armed
and unarmed combat

if they fit the stereotype

**New Powers:** The following will start at 6 if chosen: Armored
Exoskeleton (some Klangons elect to be permanently welded into their
battle-gear), Berserk (Klangons can go berserk, becoming nigh unstoppable:
treat as an automatic healing power that will Unhinder or work to
revive the Klangon if Out, after the battle the Klangon is Out even
if uninjured). Other powers unique to that particular Klangon may
be taken at 4.

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise

**Restrictions**: Psi Weakness: Klangons never defend against
Psi attacks with better than their Default Skill; Today Is A Good
Day To Die: Klangon culture forbids surrender or retreat, and any
Klangon known to have done so (even under direct orders) will be stripped
of all rank and honors and socially ostracized until he or she can
make good by dying spectacularly.

**Power Boosts**: Because Toughness was increased by 2, the Klangon
template needed 2 restrictions.

**Menton Template**

Mentons are relentlessly logical beings who've purged their society
of useless emotion, except for once every seven years when they binge
on it. Mentons are better than humans in practically every measurable
way, yet somehow always seem to find themselves in subordinate positions
to humans, who have the emotional drive to get things done.

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Logic**: 6 Mentons are relentlessly logical and capable of
lightning calculations of trajectories and probabilities that serves
them instead of formal combat training.

**Science**!: 6 Mentons are universally trained as scientists,
and have a Science! specialty just as if they were using the Scientist
template.

**Alien Metabolism**: 6 *automatic defense*. Mentons are
stronger, faster, and more resilient than humans, and many things

Punch (study of humanoid nervous systems lets them select targets

psychologists.

**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Shapeshift**: 6 Deltans can assume any form they've seen before,
of roughly the same mass; if that form has special non-technological,
non-psi powers such as claws, stings, or acid breath, they will have
those powers while in that form.

Art, Disguise, Acting

**Restrictions**: Deltans must spend 1 hour out of every 24 in
a quiescent chrysalis form.

**Power Boosts**: Deltans have one power boost, to account for
the Flexible Advantage on their regeneration.

**Warbot Template**

Warbots are robots equipped and programmed for combat.

**Attributes: Tough**: 4 **Will**: 3 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

attack.

if they fit the stereotype

heads around).

**Languages** 5

**Politics** 5

**New Powers:** The following will start at 6 if chosen: Psychological/Social
defenses such as "Let's talk this over."

with, controlling and repairing the software of other machines and
robots.

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 3 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Interface**: 6 (AA) Control. Servo-Units can control computers,
machinery, and other robots, provided they can physically interface
with them.

and are so common in any civilized high-tech facility that they generally
are unnoticed as they go about their business, even during a firefight.

**Regeneration**: 6 *automatic defense*. (A) Flexible. Deltans
are hard to hurt for very long.

**Shticks**:

speak common languages.

**Power Boosts**: Deltans have one power boost, to account for
the Flexible Advantage on their regeneration.
