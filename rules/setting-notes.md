## Martian Fauna

Most Martian fauna are hexapodal or decapodal.

- **Apt**: A large white-furred arctic creature with six limbs, four being legs, which give it rapid speed, and two being arms with hairless hands, with which it grasps prey. It has tusks growing from its lower jawbone, and large faceted, insect-like eyes. Armor 7, HD 10
- **Banth**: It has a long, sleek body, with ten legs, and large jaws equipped with several rows of sharp fangs in a mouth which extends back almost to its small ears. It is mostly hairless, except for a thick mane around the neck. It has large, protruding green eyes Armor 8, HD 11
- **Calot**: A large dog-like creature with a frog-like mouth, and three rows of teeth and ten short legs. Armor 3, HD 2
- **Darseen**: any of a number of chameleon-like reptiles, usually venomous. Armor 5, HD 1-6.
- **Darseen**, Giant Albino: Armor 5, HD 6
- **Malagor**: Enormous marsh-bird. Armor 5, HD 4
- **Orluk**: An Arctic predator with a black and yellow striped coat. Armor 6, HD 5
- **Plant-man**: They are between 10 and 12 feet in height when upright, with hairless bodies similar in form to humans, excepting broad flat feet which are 3 feet in length and a 6-foot tail, which tapers from a round profile to a flat blade shape at the tip. They also have short, sinuous arms similar to elephant trunks, ending with taloned hands with mouths set in the palms. Their faces are without mouths, with a nose like an open wound, a single white eye surrounded by a white band, and black hair 10 to 12 inches long, each strand similar in thickness to an earthworm. Despite being called men, they do not appear to be intelligent or form any sort of pack or social grouping. Armor 5, HD 6
- **Rykor:** Headless humanoid servitor race bred by the ancient Martians. Armor 0, HD 1
- **Sith**: A giant, venomous hornet-like insect. Armor 9, HD 6
- **Sorak**: A small, cat-like creature. Dodge 12, Armor 0, HD 1/2
- **Thoat**: An eight-legged horse-like creature with a wide, flat tail. Armor 2, HD 4
- **Ulsio:** Dog-sized burrowing rat-like creature.
- **White Ape**: Huge and ferocious, semi-intelligent gorilla-like creatures with an extra set of arms. Armor 6, HD 8
- **Zitidar**: A draft animal similar to a mastodon. Armor 7, HD 10

## Moons With Atmospheres

Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, Io, *(Jupiter)*, Dione, Enceladus, Rhea, and Titan *(Saturn)*, Triton (Neptune) and Titania *(Uranus)*. In the solar system of Planetary Frontiers, all of these have atmospheres dense enough to matter, and some of them are breathable, or breathable with assistance.

## The Future Is Analog

In Planetary Frontiers, tech is switches, knobs, dials and levers instead of iPads and completely digital touch screens. Not just because that fits the retro vibe, but also as a practical matter... in space, the blue screen of death can be literally that for the entire crew. Space is harsh on electronics, what with solar flares, ion storms, and the nearest chip fabrication plant 3 AU away. You can't afford a single failure taking out the entire controls of your ship; as much as possible everything needs to be separate controls that can be repaired or replaced individually with the skills and materials available to (possibly) a single crew-member. Ideally you can run the essential operations, at least the life-support, of the ship even if all the electronics are fried, if not indefinitely then long enough to repair or replace them.

There are actual physical view-ports, periscopes and optical telescopes because you don't want to be blind if your big TV fails, hatches that at least can be cranked open and shut manually if the electronics fail so you don't get stuck on the far side of a door from the part of the ship that needs repair... or has the tools and materials to carry out the repairs.

Of course, planet-side the need for simplicity and reparability isn't as stringent, and there you can find a lot of systems with more virtual interfaces and non-user-serviceable components.

## Corporations

Not your omni-malevolent cyberpunk Mega-Corps, just businesses supplying goods and services, trying to make a space-buck. They fly the passenger liners and cargo ships that the space-pirates target, they build the gizmos and gear that the PCs need. They might hire the PCs, or the PCs might be assigned to protect them from bandits and marauders targeting them. In some cases, some might be up to shenanigans, and either skirt the law or try to take advantage of it; some might even be in cahoots with space pirates or be willing to sell humanity out to the Mysterians, but by and large they're just part of the civilization that organizations like the Space Patrol are trying to protect.

Among the prominent businesses of the system are:

- **PanAm** - Space liners and particularly orbital shuttles
- **Smith & Westinghouse** - Makers of the finest zap guns.
- **General Robotics** - Premier manufacturers of positronic robots
- **MarsCorp** - Originally chartered to terraform Mars, but that project was put on hold when native Martians other than the Martian Masterminds were discovered. Now barely hanging on, on the basis of their charter monopoly of shipping through MarsPort
- **Paradigm Labs** - Where the Future is Tomorrow! Cutting edge tech and beyond; most likely to be involved in esoteric experiments involving FTL, time-travel, alternate dimensions, and the like.
- **Mitsubishi Rocket Works** - Rockets and other fine space-craft.
- **TruPonics** - Food for the Space Age! Animal Free, Chemical Free, Soylent Free! Colonists everywhere rely on TruPonics!
- **Soylent Sustainables, Inc.** - 100% Post Consumer! Everything a Body Needs! Made with Ingredients!
- **Utonium Industries** - Original inventors of, and still the largest manufacturers of, Chemical X, the only fuel capable of delivering the low-cost high-thrust continuous burn that makes modern space travel possible.
- **Barnum Broadcasting Corporation** - For all your infotainment needs.
- **Tyler Chemical** - Makers of Miraclo! The only vitamin supplement proven to prevent bone-density loss and muscle atrophy in low-G environments! Now in Venusian Mallow-fruit flavor!
- **Solar Lines** - travel the inner planets in luxury

## I want My Flying Car!

What future would be complete without flying cars. Since anti-grav is one of the forbidden technologies of the setting, flying cars make due with more prosaic enclosed rotor set-ups and aerodynamic bodies that help provide lift and steering. They are capable of vertical ascent and decent, with speeds more in line with helicopters (70-150 mph) than specialized air vehicles like planes, jets, and shuttle-craft.

A typical flying car will have a range of 8 hours on a standard vehicle battery charge (Type V), although an exploratory vehicle might have heavier-duty batteries, or even an atomic plant. They are not typically pressurized, intended for travel a few hundred feet up, and navigating by sight instead of instruments. They do usually have an auto-pilot, capable of navigating and landing autonomously, and self-piloting air-taxis are frequently employed in cities large enough to make it worthwhile.

## Tech That Doesn't Exist

The following are SF technologies that doesn't exist in the setting, unless introduced by the Referee as part of an adventure

- FTL travel and communications
- Time Travel
- Anti-gravity
- Artificial Intelligence (self-aware kind)
- Cloning (at least not that duplicates minds)
- Matter Transmission
- Portals to other dimensions or universes
- Shrinking or Growth rays

Adventures might be built around the discovery of any or all of these, but they are likely to change the setting significantly if they become widespread.

There is also tech that exists in our world that was never developed or never caught on the the setting:

- Ubiquitous cellular telephones
- The Internet
- DVDs/CD-ROM
- Touch Screens (exist on Terra in consumer goods, but isn't trusted for critical systems or in space)

## Handwavium

On the flip side of forbidden tech is tech that slides into pulp/super-science territory. Chemicals, isotopes, rays, and unknown elements with strange properties are unremarkable parts of Planetary Frontiers. Anything that we really know better now than what seemed plausible or at least vaguely possible back in the day can and should be explained by such quasi-science.

For instance, a sufficiently energetic fuel to allow the kind of full 1/3 G constant acceleration that ships in PF have isn't really possible, but that won't stop us. Thanks to Chemical X, rocket fuel that fits the bill can be refined and made available nearly everywhere in the solar system. The Miraclo vitamin allows humans to work and live in low gravity without debilitating loss of bone density and muscle mass. Etc.

## Space Suits

Space Suits, or Ships Suits, are garments worn by almost all spacers. They are skin tight to help prevent blood pooling in the extremities in Zero G, and often worn under other clothing for everyday activities. They are resistant to cutting and piercing (Armor 2), and provide insulation against the cold of space, and heat up to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as a small amount of radiation shielding (+2 on saves vs. radiation, flames, or cold). Outer layers providing more, or more specialized, protection against extreme conditions can be added. They are moisture wicking and antibacterial, so you come out of them smelling fresher than when you donned them.

Adding a bubble helmet makes them into a full-fledged Vacc Suit, with about 1 hour of air with the standard built-in air supply in the collar, or 8 hours or more with an external backpack, depending on the make. The helmet has HUD displays for monitoring vital functions and communications; specialized models may be used for more extended work, including exploration that contain things like water and food-pill dispensers. Civilian models are usually built with more idiot-proof voice and eye-movement tracking controls, while experienced spacers prefer the more robust and resilient mechanical chin controls.

A basic no-frills suit costs 30cr, while the fancier models such as ones that allow the wearer to dial different colors and patterns onto the suit or even make portions transparent can go for 200cr or more.

Passengers and other groundhogs will often go without, relying on emergency dispensers of filmy transparent single-use loose-fitting suits that can go on over their regular clothes; putting them on is like stepping into a large garbage bag with a hood that will seal onto the rest of the suit. These suits are 30cr a dozen, and have 1 hour of air before they need to be hooked to an external source. Passenger ships and life pods have such hookups spaced regularly around the passenger areas. Single suits are not usually rigged in such a way that a standard backpack can be connected (the valve is in front where the wearer can easily hook it up, instead of at the base of the neck where the pack attaches to the collar of the bubble helmet), but could be jury-rigged by an experienced spacer.

## Safe, Cheap, Clean Nuclear Power

Widespread use of a variant of pebble bed reactors that failed safe (increasing reaction produced negative feedback damping the reaction instead of positive feedback leading to a melt-down) caused the proliferation of nuclear reactors and almost completely supplanted petroleum, coal, and other such fuel sources. Rocket ships and most space installations are powered by safe atomic power plants, sometimes supplemented by solar energy either through photovoltaic panels or solar mirror turbines in the inner parts of the solar system where the energy density of sunlight doesn't require impractically large mirrors. The modern version of the portable reactors for civilian vehicles are built with no user-serviceable parts and guaranteed to be proof against crashes, with the worst case scenario the block needing to be decontaminated before being hauled away but negligible damage to the surrounding environment as long as you don't go up and lick it. Even deliberate sabotage would only cause it to stop producing power, but it can't be weaponized short of melting it all and extracting the radioactive materials to use in some other weapon.

Space ship reactors are a bit more complicated, and can be serviced by engineers, because if you're millions of miles from anywhere even a "safe" failure where it's shut down and producing no power is a disaster. Nevertheless the care and feeding of the reactor is one of the more minor duties of the power-deck crew.

## Space Food

For most voyages, the crew consume food capsules (Fud being a popular brand); they contain all the necessary nutrients in a handy pill form, and reduce the amount of solid waste the ship's systems need to process. Passengers will generally eat real food, with quality being commensurate with the price; a luxury liner might offer dining experiences on par with the better restaurants a planet or habitat has to offer.

Most inhabitants of the civilized parts of the system consume only vat-grown meats and hydroponically grown vegetables, if not outright synthetics like food capsules, for practical reasons if nothing else. Eating dead animals or anything that has grown in the dirt is viewed as barbaric, particularly by Terrans.

On colony worlds such as Venus, Ganymede, and to a lesser extent Mars, vegetation is grown through old-fashioned agriculture and the colonists swear that it tastes better and is healthier for you.

Food Capsules cost 15cr for 1 weeks' supply; regular food would cost 5cr per week planet side for what the average person would consume.

Natives generally eat what they have traditionally eaten, whether it's meat from native animals or vegetation. Some more adventurous ones may eat what the humans eat as well, though they scoff at food capsules actually counting as a meal.

Due to either panspermia or interference by the Forerunners, the proteins and micro-organisms of the worlds of the Solar System are largely compatible and no harm will come to the average inhabitant from consuming alien food, though supplements are sometimes advised for long durations without the species' native foods.

Unfortunately this means that cross-species disease is also possible, though most of the time immune systems are up to it. The exception of course, is the Martian Masterminds, who were nearly wiped out when they brought back the common cold from their second attempt at invading Earth, and there are those who worry that the same thing could happen to other species if they just stumble across the wrong disease.

## Paper

Believe it or not, paper still exists and is a major if not primary form of information storage, although it's usually synthetic materials and not pulped wood. Whatever you might say about storage capacity and searchability of computer records, whether magnetic, holographic, or laser-etched storage, space travelers need a medium that can't be disrupted by loss of power or erased by magnetic storms.

Ships charts and reference materials, and log books are still literally books, while stuff that exists purely for entertainment purposes is more likely to be recordings.

## Languages

Esperanto is the universal language of the spaceways, and the official language of Terra, Luna and the L5 habitats. Other languages exist alongside Esperanto, even on Terra, but all official signage and all labels on equipment used in space as well as all traffic control use it.

There are communities that reject its use internally, but nearly anyone that's not a barbarian can speak it.

The language skill represents fluency in a language other than Esperanto and whatever your native language might be (player's choice). Each point is another language instead of increasing fluency.

Languages can also be learned temporarily by hypno tapes; you can have as many of these simultaneously as your Psi bonus, and you can overwrite one with another, no harm done. It takes a week of sleep learning to absorb on language this way. The cost of a language tape is 500cr.

## Interplanetary Crimes

Since there is no overall governing polity of the Solar System, interplanetary crimes like international crimes of pre-space Earth, are only the crimes that the diverse governing bodies can mutually agree upon.

- Murder
- Piracy
- Kidnapping
- Slavery
- Grand Theft (excess of 1k cr)
- Grand Fraud (excess of 1k cr)
- Creating a Navigational Hazard
- Endangerment of a Habitat or Spacecraft
- Interference with a Protected Sapient Species

Smuggling is not a crime, or at least is not something that the Space Patrol gets involved in enforcing, since the list of what's contraband varies too much from habitat to habitat and is in constant flux; local authorities are expected to enforce their own rules on arrival.

The jurisdiction of the Space Patrol is technically the entire Solar System, including the orbital space around the planets, but not the planetary surfaces themselves. There is a hot-pursuit exception to discourage criminals from recklessly racing towards a planet or habitat to thwart an arrest.

## Interplanetary Punishment

In civilized areas, the punishment for crimes is psychiatric counseling, usually assisted by a trained Esper licensed by the Rhine Institute, which cures the convict's criminal tendencies. Former criminals are then naturally compelled by their consciences to make full restitution to their victims and their families, or where that is not possible make a good faith effort to somehow make up for their heinous actions.

Terra will often nonetheless exile reformed criminals, on the grounds that even their adjusted psych profiles fall outside the parameters required for citizenship.

Less civilized areas may just make convicted criminals breath space or be sacrificed to the volcano gods. Some rougher places in the Belt may not bother with the formality of conviction.

## Piracy

Piracy is a tricky proposition in space travel. The point in the journey when a ship carrying valuable cargo is usually farthest from help is the midpoint, but that's also when it's at or near its maximum velocity before it turns around and begins the long process of slowing down. It's mostly just not economical to burn enough fuel to catch up and match velocities, even if pirates could afford engines rated for the kind of Gs that would be needed.

Instead, space pirates, like most pirates in history, lurk around where ships begin and end their journeys, when they are going slowly and making predictable approaches to their ports of call. Since these are the busiest areas, they are also the most heavily patrolled and easiest for pirate hunters to give chase. On the other hand, they are the easiest for a would be pirate to pretend to be just another merchant until they have an opportunity to strike. Nonetheless, pirates are more active in the well-traveled but less densely populated areas like the Asteroid Belt, and in and among the many moons of the Outer Planets, where there are plenty of places to hide ships or even whole pirate bases.

Pirate ships tend to be small, cheap, and fast, and to take on merchants in a swarm; it's hard for a merchant ship to afford enough guns and missiles to fend off dozens of small ships that are barely more than an engine, a cockpit, and a weapon. They favor hit and run tactics, staying only long enough to extract a bribe to let the ship go on its way, or steal a small amount of its most valuable cargo or kidnap somebody for ransom. Pirates aren't going to hang around long enough to transfer large amounts of cargo, or have ships large enough to carry much of it away. Bulk freighters are tempting targets because of their low velocities and predictable minimum energy orbits, but the aim is generally extortion rather than theft. Better pay "tribute" so the ship can go on its way undamaged than risk losing it all if the pirates decide to scuttle it.

There are, of course, famed exploits where pirates have made off with entire ships, but that takes planning and a highly trained crew, a larger pirate ship than most pirates can dream of affording and somewhere to take the ship where pursuers can't easily find it... a tricky task when a ship's engines burning are generally visible all over the Solar System given a powerful enough telescope.

## Pirate Tactics

- Putting the crew and passengers overboard, in life boats or space suits, so pursuers have to rescue them.
- Dropping debris, chaff, or mines in their wake to create navigation hazards
- Using decoy missiles outfitted to confuse pursuers as which drive signatures to track
- Making sure there are near-by bodies they can duck behind to hide trajectory changes (or if there are enough or they're large enough hide on/in)
- Staging multiple simultaneous raids, including decoys, to stretch hunters' thin
- Taking hostages
- Bribing locals for info on shipping, or even having moles


## Space Patrol Tactics

The Space Patrol are the main anti-pirate force in the Solar System, and their small patrol vessels spend a lot of time in 0-G waiting near ports for the call to action. There's no point being under thrust if you might be heading in the exact opposite direction you need to go.

Generally their patrol vessels, despite only having a crew of four, are more heavily armed, capable of sustaining higher thrust, and have better communications than the pirates so a single ship represents a considerable threat to a pirate attack. Pirates will usually run from the Space Patrol; even if they could win an engagement, and even though the SP usually try to take prisoners instead of killing, the cost isn't worth it and should they win it just guarantees more resources devoted to hunting them down. Politically motivated and crazies may stand and fight, but smart pirates know that a successful raid is one where they got there, got some booty, and got out before the SP even arrive.

Since Space Patrol crews always include an Esper, and pirate crews almost never do, the Space Patrol can and will begin to respond to a distress call with contacting other SP patrol vessels via telepathy to converge on the pirates without alerting them via radio chatter. Pirates will sometimes try to jam conventional radio transmissions, but in the absence of solar activity that is suspicious in itself; there is no known way of blocking telepathic contact except by a more powerful telepath and no telepath that passes the rigorous screening and conditioning of the Rhine Institute has ever thrown their lot in with pirates.

The Space Patrol will pay a reward for live Pirates, and nothing for dead ones (too easy to claim a corpse you found or created was a pirate); they will also pay a reward for pirate vessels captured as long as they can be proved to belong to pirates, preferably through some of their crew being captured as well. The reward ranges from 1,000 cr a pirate on up for those that are more infamous. They will pay 5,000 cr+ reward for capturing a pirate ship depending on size and condition; the captors get to keep the ship, the reward is separate. Despite their standing policy for offering rewards, the rank and file Space Patrol don't regard professional bounty hunters with any great fondness. Too many bounty hunters shift back and forth over the line between piracy against pirates and piracy plain and simple.

## The Future is Color-blind

Racism is just one of the many ills that has been eliminated. Ethnic prejudice and stereotypes about old Earth cultures has also largely been supplanted by new stereotypes about planetary origin.

- Earth. Conformist sheep. Strictly from squares-ville, man.
- Luna. Non-conformist weirdos, the dumping ground for Earth's misfits.
- L5 - Trendoid hipsters
- Mars. Overly rugged individualists, think they live in the Wild West.
- Ganymede. Space Amish. Hicks.
- Venus. Dino ranchers and savages.
- Mercury. Blue collar miners. Hot-headed hard cases.
- Asteroid Belt. Crazed prospectors, space Hillbillies.

## Smoking

Smoking has been rendered medically safe, requiring merely proper filters or for those who roll their own a minor medical procedure to change lung filters about once a quarter. In any case, cancer and emphysema are eminently curable.

It's still a terrible idea in any artificial habitat, and completely taboo aboard spaceships, orbitals, and underwater habitats. Besides the terror of fire, the oils and particulates are at best expensive to clean up and filter and at worst an actual hazard degrading equipment and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure.

Because of this it's become one of the folk traditions that separates spacers from planet dwellers, with the later taking some kind of pride in the fact this is a vice they are free to enjoy that spacers cannot. Terrans may even affect a non-working pipe while aboard space vessels. Tobacco grows well on both Mars and Venus, while marijuana is primarily a Venusian export, Mars being generally too cold and with insufficient sunlight.

Popular brands are:

- Meteor Strikes - Unfiltered, are known for their no-nonsense, straightforward tobacco flavor.
- Sol Malls - long, cigarettes with advanced filtration technology that are popular among planetary settlers.
- Camelopardalis - ultra-thin and futuristic, offering a refined smoking experience.
- Venus Lights - are sleek, elegant cigarettes designed for the sophisticated women.
- Star Cross - offer a cosmic blend of tobacco and unique flavor infusions.

## Breathable Atmospheres

The following bodies have breathable atmospheres (in the game, not real life):

- Mercury (with help)
- Venus
- Terra
- Mars, in the lowlands.
- Titan
- Ganymede

It is known that several of these bodies would not have an atmosphere or it would not be breathable if it weren't for mysterious pyramids left by the Forerunners. Mars had a denser atmosphere before the Martian Masterminds sabotaged the air generators in an attempt to exterminate all other Martian life forms as their own civilization was dying.

## The Mysterians

They claim to hail from a distant star-system, although in the past they claimed to come from Planet X, a counter-Earth always on the far side of the Sun from Terra, before scientists proved that was impossible. They first appeared in 1957, saying they came in peace but actually seeking to capture Earth women to repopulate their dying planet. They were driven off, but returned in secret in their flying saucers to capture humans again and again, before being driven from the Inner System by the brave forces of the Earth Defense Force (which evolved into the Space Patrol) operating from the first Moon Base which became operational in 1970. They no longer communicate with humankind, seeming to prefer to simply take what they want by force.

Today it is believed the Mysterians did originally hail from another star system, although there is debate as to whether they arrived in the Sol System aboard some sort of generation ship or whether they actually have FTL drive as they once claimed. Certainly their flying saucers do not use any sort of conventional drive known to human science, able to hover in an atmosphere and accelerate far beyond speeds human vessels can sustain. On the other hand, none of their saucers has ever been observed transitioning to light speed or otherwise violating fundamental laws of physics; whatever propels them seems to have the same limits human vessels do, even if possessed of some extraordinarily efficient propulsion. Nor do they possess any sort of force field that would render conventional weapons useless. This is what allows human vessels and their weapons to be effective even against their advanced technology.

The Mysterians still prey upon shipping and isolated outposts in the outer system, and occasionally make stealthy raids into the inner system always seeking to capture humans, preferably women. What few corpses of Mysterians have been recovered suggest that human tissues are used as transplants to shore up the Mysterians biological systems, that have been weakened and damaged by radiation and mutation. It has been suggested, however, that humans have never actually seen a true Mysterian, and the Mysterians have been using human stock captured perhaps long ago as slaves or puppets. This would explain the compatibility between human tissue and the captured corpses, although skeptics point out that could be explained as the Forerunners program of panspermia seeding extrasolar planets as well.

Mysterians will always seek to capture or at least retrieve relatively intact bodies, so they eschew the disintegrator beams and terrible heat rays of the martians, favoring stunners and other incapacitating weapons. In space battles they seek to disable their prey, though they will not hesitate to use beam weapons to seek to destroy Space Patrol vessels that interfere.


## The Future is Metric

### Tips For Americans

- Comfortable Room Temperature 20°-25°
- Body Temperature 37°
- Avg Height Male 177 cm, Female 165 cm
- Avg weight 83 kg/ 51 kg


## The Future Is Capitalist

Although there are some notable communities like Novyy Stalingrad on Luna that are defiantly communist, and plenty of tiny communities that practice some form of socialism within the community if they're not too small to have an economy altogether, most of the Solar System allows private property and ownership of the means of production. You are allowed to own your own spaceship, strike it rich as a prospector in the Belt, build a farm with your own two hands on Ganymede, start a dino ranch on Venus, and so on. If you need money, you're expected to earn it. It is up to the individual communities what they do about the indigent and those unable to provide for themselves; they almost all do something, though in the harsher environments that something may be to ship them off to somewhere else.

Even Terra, with its cradle-to-grave welfare system for the masses, is largely based on free enterprise for those who elect to produce the wealth that it requires for the consumer class, albeit under the regulation and guidance of the Giant Electronic Brain GEB, as directed by the Science Council.

The form of money used universally in the Solar System is the credit, abbreviated Cr, and symbolized by Ꞓ. Ꞓ 1000/month pays for a standard middle-class lifestyle on Luna, the Orbitals, or Terra if you've opted in to the market system. Local polities might have their own currency in addition or instead of credits, but the players generally won't have to worry about exchange rates unless somehow that is the focus of an adventure. E.g. they take on a well-paying job only to find they're paid in the local currency and now they have to figure out how to horse trade so they can fly away with something they can use.

## Utility Belts

All gear that's intended for use in space, whether shipboard or in EVA comes equipped with a universal socket to clip onto your space suit's utility belt, which has numerous attachment points each with a tether and reel that keeps it out of the way when holstered and puts it under just enough tension that it doesn't drift around and loop or get caught on anything when the gear is in use. The tether will slowly auto-retract if the piece of gear is released, but that behavior can be overridden if for some reason you need to leave the unit free-floating temporarily; caution is advised since that's a good way to get tangled up.

Most space gear will also come with one or more points of attachment that are a combination of weak magnet and stick-it (gekko-like friction micro-grips) that will let you stick the piece of gear against any reasonably flat or magnetic surface and have it adhere at least enough to not be moved by minor air currents or vibration. It won't hold up to any real force or sudden acceleration, so once again a modicum of caution is advised. Most of the time even if it shakes loose it will just be reeled in by the tether.


## The Future is Atheist

Or at least a-religious. The discovery of the ruins left by the Forerunners, and evidence of the fairly massive scale they intervened in the Solar System before disappearing took the wind out of the sails of most of the major religions. If God created the Universe, he seemed to have sub-contracted the work of creating mankind. Naturally some tried to cast the Forerunners as divine intermediaries, either angelic or demonic, but the ruins and artifacts they left were too prosaic for that to be satisfying for the majority of people. The bulk of humanity just sort of lost interest in religion, while the few diehards generally banded together to create a settlement somewhere off Earth where they could continue their traditions and practices in isolation. Often, as with other isolationist philosophical movements, the following generations drifted back to more mainstream beliefs even if they didn't abandon the old ways altogether.

There is only one organized church, if it can be called that, with any great following: the Church of Universal Siblinghood (Preĝejo de Universala Gefrateco). They preach that all sapient beings are siblings, and rise of sapience is the purpose of the Universe. They are pacifists, at least as far as sapient species go, even claiming that the Martian Masterminds are ultimately siblings of humanity... even if no communication with them has ever been successful. They are mostly understood by the populace at large as a charitable organization, and you can always find a bed and a meal at one of their chapter-houses in almost any civilized area and a surprising number of uncivilized ones if you're down on your luck.

## Robots

Artificial intelligence has so far proved impossible, so all robots and computers are not self-aware and lack volition. They follow orders and when not carrying out an order suspend their operations.

Robots come in two basic varieties, smart robots with positronic brains who follow the Three Laws, and more primitive dumb robots without.

On civilized planets, construction or importation of non-positronic brain robots is strictly limited to non-critical areas where there is no possible interaction with humans other than the robot's operators. In practice that means you could have a dumb robot forklift in an automated factory, but you would need a smart robot to staff a ticket counter at a space port.

Most ships, even technically one-man jobs, will have a positronic brain robot to provide backup to the pilot operator.

The largest purveyor of robots is General Robotics, founded by the inventor of the positronic brain.

GEB, the Giant Electronic Brain of the Terran Science Council, is a positronic robot.


## Terra

Terra is a non-ironic Utopian technocratic society, run on utilitarian/consequentialist grounds which enforces conformity by exiling misfits and malcontents to space. This is not seen, by Terrans, as a punishment, merely an attempt to adjust circumstances of those unfortunate enough not to fit in with the Terran ethos in the way that's least disruptive to society. Those who nonetheless wish to stay are given a choice between psychological intervention to help them fit in, or self-isolation to one of the areas of the planet reserved for communities who cannot or will not get with the program.

Most Terrans live in one of the mega-cities: New Ark, New Angeles, London, New Paris, New New Delhi, Neo Tokyo, New Beijing, etc. The rest of the planet has largely returned to park and wilderness areas, as the outflow of migrants depopulated much of the planet while simultaneously most heavy industry moved to orbit. Power is provided by safe, clean, efficient nuclear energy, while robots and automated systems do almost all of the dangerous or mindless, tedious physical work.

Terra of 2001 has banished all poverty, sickness and war. Violent crime is nearly non-existent due to continuous cradle-to-grave monitoring of all citizens. The world is united under a single benevolent government called the Terran Establishment, guided by the Science Council with the assistance of GEB, the Giant Electronic Brain in charge of planning the economy. The economy is nominally capitalist, in that private property and private enterprise are not per-se forbidden, but is under such tight regulation that most enterprises choose to incorporate elsewhere, particularly in the Lunar Free State.

Every citizen receives a basic stipend but is required to work at the job they are most suited to perform, according to a battery of tests including psychological tests administered throughout their education. They must fulfill their duties as citizens, including marriage and children by certain specific ages, unless granted exemptions due to the nature of their work. The stipend is sufficient to cover all basic needs: food in pill form, generic housing, clothing, etc. Such medical needs as people have after the elimination of bacterial and viral diseases, and genetic defects, tend to be injuries or exposure to toxic substances that can be treated cheaply and efficiently by auto-docs, and treatment is covered by the state.

Those who voluntarily renounce their citizenship, or who are convicted of Bohemianism, are given one-way tickets to the Inner-system destination of their choice. Those with exceptional qualifications or special talents may be forwarded to one of the services such as the Space Rangers, or Interplanetary Rescue while still retaining their Terran citizenship.

Terra is by design a place for characters to be from, rather than somewhere to go in order to adventure.

## Luna

The oldest human colony, the only one whose settlement pre-dated the unification of Earth into the Terran Establishment, it has three major cities, based around the original settlements of Luna City, Tsiolkovsky Gorod, and Oberthstadt. Luna City is the capitol of the Lunar Free State, the largest and most populous of the current lunar settlements, though there are hundreds if not thousands of smaller settlements scattered over the light side of the moon, as well as a handful including some research facilities on the dark side.

Most Lunar settlements are well underground, with the Lunar surface regulating their temperature and shielding them from radiation and meteorite strikes. Water and oxygen are both easy to extract from Lunar soil, and the long Lunar days and lack of atmosphere make solar power a reasonably reliable and cheap supplement to their nuclear plants. Lunar hydroponics are second to none in the Solar System, and form a substantial part of their exports to the outer planets, and unlike Terrans Loonies have never taken to the "pill and paste" meal.

Luna City is located in Tycho crater near the original moon landing site in the sea of Tranquility, while Novyy Stalingrad is in Langrenus crater, and Oberthstadt to the Lunar West in Copernicus crater. Positioning the major settlements within the crater walls offers some engineering benefits in digging the underground cities as well as some minor protection from glancing impacts by meteorites. Luna City is the only fully-domed city of the major cities of Luna, and is the home of the Lunar Government, Port Tycho, the single largest space port in the Solar System, and the main campus of the Rhine Institute, providers of training and certification for all licensed Espers in the System. Novyy Stalingrad discourages visitors and little is known about its current conditions.

Generally speaking the Loonies are allergic to central authority, with the War for Lunar Freedom being a touchstone of their culture despite it happening over sixty years prior, and most of the recent immigrants being exiles from Terra thanks to its policy of exiling misfits and malcontents. The War for Lunar Freedom's proximate cause was the Tranquility Massacre, when Terran forces asphyxiated over 200 hundred protesters encamped in the Tranquility dome as a protest against the new Terran policy of mandatory genetic screening; it ended when the League of Earth government was dissolved and reformed into the current Terran Establishment under pressure from the defections of member states seeking to end the bombardment of Earth from the Lunar rebel's mass-drivers.

The Loonies devolve political authority to the most local level practical, with the different settlements all being semi-autonomous and organized in a variety of different fashions. Luna City itself is organized as a municipality with an elected Mayor and City Council, while Tsiolkovsky Gorod, renamed to Novyy Stalingrad in the 1940s is the last holdout in the system of old-style Stalinist communism. Smaller settlements can consist of single families or more extended clans, or are organized as limited liability corporations, partnerships, artists' collectives, anarcho-syndicalist communes, and so on. Many only last a few years, or a single generation, before proving impractical or the founders' children turning out to have no particular desire to carry on their parents' political experiments. But as the popular Loonie saying goes "Tain't Nobody's Business But Their Own" (TNBBTO).

On matters affecting the entire moon, such as orbital traffic control, mutual defense, and inter-settlement law they choose a governing committee by moot of all adult citizens. In order to ensure that the Executive is merely carrying out policies agreed upon by the committees, Executive power lies with the Giant Electronic Brain Watson, which as a positronic brain lacks volition and self-awareness and is incapable of having an agenda of its own. Judicial authority rests with magistrates selected by lottery from qualified adult citizens, with the aid of Watson for the legal niceties.

Committee purviews are strictly limited to the matter brought to moot, and there are multiple committees each with their own area of responsibility in operation at the same time. Coordination is handled by Watson, and disagreements are brought back to the moot.

The Lunar Constitution guarantees all citizens, regardless of their local polity, the right to participate in the moot, the right of exit to another polity or of the moon altogether.

Luna is home-base to many corporations that operate in the Solar System, among the largest being General Robotics, Pan-Am, and Mitsubishi Rocket Works, both because of its convenience in proximity to Terra with much more reasonable energy-to-orbit requirements and its relatively laissez-faire legal system that adds few burdens on top of whatever local regulations they have to abide by in the other locales they do business.

Luna is also one of the main bases of the Space Patrol, going all the way back to the first Patrol Moon Base established as a forward post and launching point against the height of Mysterian activity on Terra in the early 1970's. Patrol Base Alpha is located slightly South-West of Oberthstadt, in Kepler crater.

Loonies have the option to gen-modify themselves, in order to avoid the difficulties they face in visiting or working in the 1G environments that humans favor in most of the rest of the system. The gen-modifications strengthen their bones and muscles to put them on par with Terrans, but have the side effect of turning their hair purple and metallic. The treatment is expensive, so most Loonies won't bother with it unless they plan to spend significant time off of Luna; the treatment is free for members of the Space Patrol, so it is common for them to get it regardless.
