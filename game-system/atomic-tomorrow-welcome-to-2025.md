# WELCOME TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN THE FARFLUNG YEAR OF... 2025

## THE ATOMIC AGE REALIZED

Welcome to the Solar System of 2025, where the dreams of yesterday have become the realities of today! The atom has been harnessed, the planets conquered, and humanity has rocketed its way across the void between worlds. This is not the cramped, digital future of screens and virtual realities—this is the expansive future of gleaming rockets, daring explorers, and adventure among the stars!

## THE ANALOG FUTURE

In this retro-futuristic world, technology followed a different path than our own history. The digital revolution never happened; instead, the atom was mastered and space was conquered.

Spacecraft dashboards are filled with switches, knobs, dials, and levers rather than touchscreens. This isn't just an aesthetic choice—it's a practical matter of survival. In the harsh environment of space, a single system failure can't be allowed to take out all controls. Every crucial function has a mechanical backup, and repairs can be made with the skills and tools available to a single crew member.

Even the most advanced computers use vacuum tubes and mechanical relays rather than microchips. Data is stored on magnetic tape, punch cards, or laser-etched discs rather than flash memory. Communications equipment has physical dials for frequency tuning and actual buttons for transmitting.

This analog approach extends to spacecraft design as well. Ships have actual viewports alongside video screens, manual hatches that can be cranked open when power fails, and systems designed to be repaired by human hands rather than automated diagnostics.

The discovery of Nth metal in the wreckage of Mysterion craft - a material with unique gravitational properties - has enabled practical flying cars without rewriting the laws of physics. Nth metal interacts with gravitational fields, reducing an object's effective mass by up to 90% near planetary surfaces (though this effect diminishes in space). Combined with conventional propulsion systems, Nth metal allows for sleek flying vehicles with all the chrome and tailfins the atomic age aesthetic demands, while maintaining the analog control systems of dials, pedals, and manual stabilizer adjustments that characterize this technological path.

## SAFE, CLEAN NUCLEAR POWER

The atomic tomorrow is powered by the atom itself. Pebble-bed and miniature foam-core reactors that fail safe have proliferated throughout the Solar System, providing abundant energy with minimal risk. These reactors cannot melt down—increased reaction produces negative feedback that dampens the reaction rather than accelerates it.

Rockets, space stations, and even many personal vehicles are powered by small, safe atomic power plants. Solar panels and mirrors supplement these where practical, but it's the atom that truly powers civilization.

Chemical X, the revolutionary rocket fuel developed by Utonium Industries in 2024, has transformed space travel from a months-long ordeal to a journey of days. This miracle fuel provides extraordinary thrust-to-mass ratios and efficiency that defies conventional physics, enabling the 1/3G constant acceleration that makes interplanetary travel practical.

## THE PLANETS AND THEIR PEOPLES

### TERRA (EARTH)

The cradle of humanity has grown into a tightly regulated utopia under the guidance of the Terran Establishment and the Science Council. Crime, disease, poverty, and war have been eliminated through a combination of social engineering, technological innovation, and the assistance of GEB, the Giant Electronic Brain that helps plan the economy.

Terran society values conformity and stability above all, with citizens assigned to the work they're best suited for according to psychological and aptitude tests. Those who cannot or will not conform are given one-way tickets to other worlds, making Terra a place that many characters are from rather than a destination for adventure.

Most Terrans live in gleaming megacities with names like New Ark, New Angeles, and Neo Tokyo, while the rest of the planet has been returned to pristine wilderness. Robots and automated systems handle most dangerous or tedious work, and the population enjoys a comfortable standard of living through a generous stipend system.

### LUNA (THE MOON)

The oldest human colony, Luna, is a patchwork of settlements and ideologies united by a fierce independence from Terra. Loonies, as they call themselves, bear the imprint of the War for Lunar Freedom that ended sixty years ago when Lunar rebels used mass-drivers to bombard Earth until the League of Earth government was dissolved.

Most Lunar settlements are well underground, shielded from radiation and meteorites by the Lunar soil. The three major cities—Luna City in Tycho crater, Novyy Stalingrad in Langrenus crater, and Oberthstadt in Copernicus crater—each have their own distinctive character and governmental systems.

Luna City, the only fully-domed major city, is home to the Lunar Government, Port Tycho (the largest spaceport in the Solar System), and the main campus of the Rhine Institute, which trains and certifies all licensed Espers.

Lunar politics favors local autonomy, with settlements organized in a bewildering variety of ways. Some are municipalities with elected officials, others are communes, corporations, or even family compounds. On matters affecting the entire moon, decisions are made by a moot of all adult citizens and executed by a Giant Electronic Brain called Watson, which lacks the volition to pursue its own agenda.

Loonies are generally smaller and weaker than Terrans due to the low gravity, but some opt for genetic modification that strengthens their bones and muscles at the cost of turning their hair purple and metallic.

### MARS

The red planet is home to both human colonists and native Martians, including the enigmatic Martian Masterminds who once ruled the planet and the more common Red Martians with their psychic abilities. Human settlements are concentrated in the lowlands, where the Forerunner atmospheric generators maintain a breathable, if thin, atmosphere.

Mars has a frontier feel, with rugged individualists carving out a living through farming, mining, and trade. The ruins of ancient Martian civilization dot the landscape, tempting explorers and archaeologists with the promise of forgotten technology and knowledge.

The planet hosts a diverse ecosystem of native hexapodal or decapodal fauna, including the fearsome White Apes, the horse-like Thoats used as mounts, and the loyal dog-like Calots that often accompany Martian hunters.

### VENUS

Beneath the thick cloud layer of Venus lies a lush, prehistoric world teeming with dinosaur-like creatures and dense jungle vegetation. Human settlements, primarily domed or floating cloud cities, cling to existence in this harsh but resource-rich environment.

The Venusian frontier attracts a mix of scientists, prospectors, and adventurers drawn by the planet's unique flora and fauna. Dino ranchers round up and domesticate the native creatures, while botanists study the exotic plants for their medicinal properties.

Venusian cloud drifters, nomadic communities that float among the upper atmosphere, maintain a distinct culture based on wind reading and atmospheric navigation. The planet's constant environmental dangers breed a tough, adaptable population known for their survival skills.

### MERCURY

Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury hosts several mining colonies in its perpetual twilight zone. These settlements extract valuable minerals and metals from the planet's crust, protected from the extreme temperatures by underground habitats.

Mercurians are known as tough, no-nonsense people adapted to harsh conditions. The intense solar radiation and extreme temperature variations have led to unique architectural and engineering solutions, including mirror fields to redirect sunlight for power generation.

### THE ASTEROID BELT

The Belt is the wild frontier of the Solar System, a region of countless rocky bodies rich in minerals and other resources. Belters live on or inside these asteroids, mining their wealth or serving the prospectors, traders, and occasionally pirates who traverse this chaotic region.

Ceres, the largest body in the Belt, hosts the Belt's administrative headquarters and primary trade center. Its noticeable if weak gravity (around %3 of a g) and substantial water resources nearby made it an ideal location for early Belt colonization.

Belt settlements range from corporate mining operations to independent prospector claims, from luxurious habitats for the wealthy to rough-and-tumble outposts barely clinging to existence. The dispersed nature of the Belt makes it difficult to police, creating havens for those who prefer to operate outside the law.

### THE JOVIAN SYSTEM

The moons of Jupiter—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—each host their own distinctive colonies. Ganymede, with its breathable atmosphere (thanks to Forerunner technology), is particularly well-settled, with farming communities providing food for much of the outer system.

The Jovian colonies maintain a complex relationship with both the inner planets and each other, with trade routes connecting them to the broader Solar System economy. The intense radiation from Jupiter itself presents unique challenges to colonists, leading to specialized habitation designs and protective measures.

### THE SATURNIAN SYSTEM

Saturn's major moons—Titan, Enceladus, Dione, and Rhea—host scientific outposts and specialized industrial facilities. Titan, with its dense atmosphere, has developed into a significant population center with unique cultural traditions based on hydrocarbon chemistry and cold-weather adaptation.

The distinctive ring system of Saturn provides both navigational hazards and opportunities for resource extraction, with specialized "ring miners" harvesting ice and other materials.

### THE OUTER PLANETS

Neptune, Uranus, and their moons host small scientific outposts and monitoring stations, serving as humanity's furthest permanent presence in the Solar System. These remote stations are valued for astronomical observations and early warning of Mysterion activity from the deep void.

Pluto and its outposts represent the very edge of mapped space, with their inhabitants adapted to extreme isolation and self-sufficiency. These frontier scientists and observers keep watch on the darkness beyond the Solar System, often the first to detect unusual phenomena or potential threats.

## MAJOR FACTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS

### THE SPACE PATROL

Born from the Earth Defense Force that repelled the first Mysterion invasions, the Space Patrol serves as the peacekeeping force throughout the Solar System. Their jurisdiction covers all of space between planetary surfaces, with bases on Luna, Mars, and other strategic locations.

The Space Patrol enforces interplanetary law, focuses on preventing and responding to piracy, and stands as humanity's first line of defense against Mysterion incursions. Operating across vast distances with limited communication capabilities, patrol captains must exercise significant autonomy and judgment in the field.

Communication across the vast distances of space relies on the same system of relay stations that serves all interplanetary traffic. Key facilities like Venus Equilateral Station maintain constant contact with multiple planets regardless of their orbital positions, allowing messages to be passed from one relay to the next. However, these communications remain bound by the speed of light, creating inevitable delays between sending a message and receiving a response.

These communication constraints have shaped the Patrol's operational doctrine—ships receive general orders and mission parameters before departure, with captains empowered to interpret and execute those orders as circumstances require. Upon returning to communication range, crews may find their actions subjected to review, occasionally leading to tension between field officers and command staff with the benefit of hindsight.

Patrol vessels are typically small but powerful craft with advanced weapons and propulsion systems, capable of responding quickly to distress calls and sustaining pursuit of pirate vessels. The Space Patrol pays bounties for captured pirates and pirate vessels, though they maintain a sometimes tense relationship with bounty hunters who skirt the line between legality and piracy themselves.

Regional Patrol bases serve as communication hubs, coordinating operations within their sphere of influence through conventional radio communications. For emergencies beyond direct radio range, patrol ships relay messages through the network of communication stations, accepting the inevitable light-speed delay.

## THE RHINE INSTITUTE

Founded in 1976 after early ESP research discovered potentially dangerous uncontrolled psychics, the Rhine Institute identifies, trains, and regulates those with psionic abilities. Based primarily on Luna, with smaller campuses on Terra, Mars, and other major settlements, the Institute serves several crucial functions in Solar System society.

The Institute's primary mission focuses on the ethical application of psionic abilities in specialized fields:

 **Judicial Services** : Rhine-certified Espers assist the courts throughout the Solar System, using their abilities to verify testimony and determine the truth in complex cases. Under strict protocols to protect privacy rights, these judicial Espers only examine thoughts directly relevant to the case at hand, serving as living lie detectors rather than mind readers. Their evidence is admissible in most jurisdictions, though the specific weight given to psionic testimony varies by legal system.

 **Psychiatric Rehabilitation** : Perhaps the Institute's most controversial role involves the rehabilitation of criminal offenders. Specially trained therapeutic Espers work with convicted criminals to identify and modify the psychological patterns that led to criminal behavior. This process, known colloquially as "getting blanked," reshapes the criminal's mind to develop natural aversions to harmful actions without removing their identity or free will. The program boasts high success rates in preventing recidivism, though critics question both its ethics and the potential for subtle personality changes in treated individuals.

 **Intelligence Operations** : A small, carefully selected corps of Espers works with various planetary governments and the Space Patrol on counter-espionage and intelligence gathering. These operatives undergo rigorous psychological screening and ethical training to prevent misuse of their abilities. Their existence is something of an open secret, with most governments publicly denying or downplaying their involvement with psionic agents while privately making extensive use of their services.

 **Research** : The Institute continuously studies the nature and limits of psionic abilities, developing new training techniques and applications while monitoring for potential health effects of prolonged psionic activity. This research has identified the mathematical principles governing psionic phenomena, including the inverse square law of telepathic range and the energy cost of telekinetic manipulation.

All legally operating Espers must be certified by the Institute, which requires passing rigorous ethical examinations in addition to demonstrating control of their abilities. Uncertified psychics are required to register with the Institute and submit to regular monitoring, though enforcement of this requirement varies widely across different jurisdictions.

The Institute maintains a complex relationship with governments throughout the Solar System. While their services are valued, the potential power of unregulated psychics creates lingering suspicion and occasional calls for tighter restrictions. The Institute walks a careful line between cooperating with authorities and protecting the rights and well-being of psychics themselves.

### CORPORATIONS

The Solar System's economy is driven by numerous corporations providing goods and services across the planets. These range from massive conglomerates like Utonium Industries (creators of Chemical X) to specialized operations like Tyler Chemical (makers of Miraclo vitamin supplements).

Notable corporations include:

 **Aerospace & Transportation** : Mitsubishi Rocket Works, PanAm, Solar Lines, Utonium Industries, Lockheed Orbital, Korolev Heavy Industries, Ares Aerodyne, Venusian Cloudcraft

 **Weapons & Defense** : Smith & Westinghouse, Colt-Samsung, Raytheon Targeting, Armstrong Armaments

 **Technology & Robotics** : General Robotics, Atomcomp, Vac-Tube Electronics, Luna Communications

 **Resource Extraction** : MarsCorp, Belter Consolidated Mining, Tycho Rare Earths, Jovian Gas, Mercury Solar

 **Consumer Goods & Services** : TruPonics, Soylent Sustainables Inc., Tyler Chemical, Barnum Broadcasting Corporation, Atomicorp

 **Research & Development** : Paradigm Labs, Rhine Psychotronics, Venusian Pharmaceuticals, Ganymede Genetics

Unlike the megacorporations of cyberpunk fiction, these businesses generally operate within legal frameworks, though some may skirt regulations or engage in ethically questionable practices in pursuit of profit.

## CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

### INTERPLANETARY LAW

The absence of a unified Solar System government means that "interplanetary law" is limited to crimes that diverse planetary authorities mutually agree upon. The Space Patrol enforces this limited framework of universally recognized offenses:

* **Murder**: The unlawful killing of sapient beings
* **Piracy**  Armed attacks on vessels in space
* **Kidnapping**: Unlawful detention and transport of persons against their will
* **Slavery**: Holding sapient beings in involuntary servitude
* **Grand Theft**: Theft of property valued over $100 credits
* **Grand Fraud**: Deception resulting in losses exceeding $100 credits
* **Creating Navigational Hazards**: Deliberately endangering space travel
* **Endangerment of Habitats**: Actions that threaten the integrity of space habitats
* **Interference with Protected Species**: Harming recognized sapient species

Notably absent from this list is smuggling, which varies too dramatically between jurisdictions to enforce consistently. Local authorities are expected to enforce their own contraband regulations upon arrival or departure from their territories. Drug laws, weapons restrictions, and prohibitions on specific technologies differ widely across the Solar System, creating opportunities for those willing to transport goods across jurisdictional boundaries.

The Space Patrol's jurisdiction technically encompasses the entire Solar System but excludes planetary surfaces. They operate under a "hot pursuit" exception that allows them to follow criminals to the ground if necessary, preventing escapes by reckless atmospheric plunges.

### JUSTICE SYSTEMS

Punishment for crimes varies dramatically across the Solar System, reflecting the diverse sociopolitical systems that have developed on different worlds:

 **Terra**: The Terran Establishment relies primarily on psychiatric rehabilitation administered by Rhine Institute Espers. Convicted criminals undergo mandatory therapy that reshapes their minds to eliminate criminal tendencies. After treatment, reformed offenders feel compelled by their conscience to make restitution to victims when possible. However, even after rehabilitation, many convicts face exile from Terra's carefully balanced society.

 **Luna**: The fiercely independent Lunar settlements maintain diverse legal systems, united only by the constitutional right to exit any polity. Punishment ranges from fines and community service in Luna City to labor in hydrogen mines in some of the more authoritarian settlements. Novyy Stalingrad is rumored to maintain Stalinist-era punishment practices, though few outsiders have verified these claims.

 **Mars**: Frontier justice prevails in many Martian settlements, with punishments designed to be practical in resource-limited environments. Community service, restitution, and exile are common, with imprisonment reserved for the most dangerous offenders due to the resource cost of maintaining detention facilities.

 **Venus**: The challenging environment of Venus has created a pragmatic approach to justice. Minor offenses typically result in additional habitat maintenance duties, while serious crimes may lead to exile to the surface in minimal survival gear—effectively a death sentence unless the offender reaches another settlement.

 **The Belt**: Justice in the Asteroid Belt varies from corporate security enforcement to informal community judgment. In the most remote or lawless areas, self-defense and personal retribution remain the primary means of addressing wrongdoing, with formal legal processes available only in the larger settlements like Ceres.

### EXTRADITION AND ASYLUM

Without a unified government, extradition between planetary jurisdictions depends on bilateral agreements that vary widely in their terms and enforcement. Certain habitats have developed reputations as safe havens for specific types of offenders, though few places will knowingly harbor those guilty of the universally recognized interplanetary crimes.

The Space Patrol has limited authority to transport prisoners to face justice in the jurisdiction where their crimes were committed, provided those crimes fall under interplanetary law. Local authorities may assist or hinder these efforts depending on their own political considerations and relationship with the requesting jurisdiction.

### LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY

Law enforcement technology varies dramatically across the Solar System, creating plenty of opportunities for clever criminals and the detectives who pursue them:

 **Terra** : The Terran Establishment employs advanced surveillance systems and biometric identification in its pristine mega-cities. Crime rates are minimal thanks to cradle-to-grave monitoring and immediate Rhine Institute intervention for antisocial behavior.

 **Everywhere Else** : Beyond Terra's controlled environment, law enforcement relies on more traditional methods:

 **Identification** : Fingerprinting and basic facial recognition exist, but disguises, false identification papers, and good old-fashioned bribes still work wonders. Smart criminals know to wear gloves and keep their faces hidden.

 **Forensic Science** : While scientific principles are well understood, forensic equipment tends to be bulky, expensive, and concentrated in major population centers. Remote outposts might have a single overworked doctor doubling as forensic specialist with limited equipment.

 **Surveillance** : Most settlements maintain cameras at key locations like spaceports and government buildings, but comprehensive coverage is rare outside Terra. The Belt and frontier regions may have no official surveillance at all, relying instead on the time-honored tradition of nosy neighbors and informants.

 **Communications** : Law enforcement often struggles with the same communication challenges as everyone else. A clever fugitive can stay ahead of pursuit by exploiting relay delays and jurisdictional boundaries.

 **Weapons** : While officers typically carry stun weapons for crowd control, many also pack conventional sidearms, especially in dangerous regions. Space Patrol vessels are well-armed but limited in number, creating perfect opportunities for daring space pirates to strike and vanish.

### THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD

Criminal organizations persist throughout the Solar System, adapting to the technological and social environments of different worlds:

 **Smuggling Syndicates** : The inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions create profitable opportunities for those willing to transport restricted goods. The most successful smugglers combine legitimate shipping operations with hidden compartments and falsified documentation, blending into normal commercial traffic.

 **Black Market Networks** : Underground marketplaces exist in every major settlement, dealing in everything from unlicensed technology to restricted cultural materials. These networks operate through encrypted communications, temporary physical locations, and trusted intermediaries.

 **Information Brokers** : Perhaps the most valuable commodity in the information age is secrets—corporate, governmental, or personal. Specialized operatives gather, analyze, and sell sensitive information to the highest bidder, using both high-tech methods and old-fashioned human intelligence.

 **Pirate Bands** : Space pirates typically operate small, fast ships that attack merchants in swarms, overwhelming defenses through numbers rather than superior firepower. These groups establish hidden bases in remote asteroids or outer moons, occasionally forming temporary alliances for larger operations before dissolving back into competing factions.

For adventurers in the Atomic Tomorrow, the complex patchwork of laws and enforcement creates both opportunities and risks. A cargo prohibited on Terra might fetch premium prices on Luna, while an action perfectly legal in the Belt could result in imprisonment on Mars. Navigating these legal complexities becomes part of the challenge—and excitement—of interplanetary adventure...

## THREATS TO PEACE

### THE MysterionS

These enigmatic beings first appeared in 1957, claiming to come in peace while actually seeking to capture Earth women to repopulate their dying race. After multiple invasions and abductions, they were driven from the Inner System by Earth's defense forces in 1970.

Today, Mysterions continue to prey upon shipping and isolated outposts in the outer system, occasionally making stealthy raids into the inner system. Their flying saucers use propulsion technology unknown to human science, allowing them to hover in atmosphere and accelerate far beyond the capabilities of human vessels.

The few recovered Mysterion corpses suggest they use human tissues as transplants to shore up their radiation-damaged biological systems. Some theorize that humans have never actually seen true Mysterions, only human slaves or puppets controlled by the real aliens.

Unlike the Martian Masterminds, Mysterions favor capture over killing, using stunners and other non-lethal weapons to take human prisoners. In space battles, they aim to disable rather than destroy their targets, though they will use deadly force against Space Patrol vessels.

### SPACE PIRATES

Despite the difficulties of interception in open space, piracy flourishes around busy shipping lanes and ports, where vessels move predictably and at lower velocities. Pirates typically operate small, fast ships that attack merchants in swarms, overwhelming their defenses through numbers rather than superior firepower.

Most pirates focus on quick raids—extorting bribes to let ships continue their journey, stealing small amounts of valuable cargo, or kidnapping wealthy passengers for ransom. Few pirates have the resources or facilities to capture entire ships, though legendary exploits of such grand thefts do exist.

Pirate tactics include:

* Forcing crews and passengers into lifeboats or space suits
* Dropping debris or mines to hamper pursuit
* Using decoys and simultaneous raids to stretch defenders thin
* Taking hostages to prevent retaliation
* Establishing bases in remote asteroids or outer moons

### LOCAL CONFLICTS

While major interplanetary wars are rare, tensions between settlements and factions occasionally flare into violence. Resource disputes in the Belt, territorial claims on Mars or Venus, and ideological conflicts can all lead to armed confrontation requiring Space Patrol intervention.

These local conflicts often provide opportunities for mercenaries, mediators, and opportunists to profit from the chaos while potentially exacerbating the situation. The Space Patrol's jurisdiction limitations sometimes create power vacuums that criminal organizations and corrupt officials exploit.

## COMMUNICATION AND TRAVEL

### LANGUAGE

Esperanto serves as the universal language of the spaceways and the official language of Terra, Luna, and the L5 habitats. While other languages continue to exist, all official signage, equipment labels, and traffic control communications use Esperanto.

Most educated people throughout the Solar System speak Esperanto, though isolated communities and those rejecting broader Solar society may stick exclusively to their native tongues. Language tapes using hypno-learning techniques allow temporary fluency in unfamiliar languages for those willing to deal with the headaches of learning a new tongue. Literally: hypno-learning causes a fierce headache that incapacitates the learner for a day, and inflicts a -5% penalty on all actions for the rest of the week.  After that the acquisition is permanent, but if another hypno-course is started before the week is up the first is lost.

### INTERPLANETARY TRANSIT

Travel between planets has been revolutionized by Chemical X fuel, which allows rockets to maintain 1/3G acceleration for extended periods. This has reduced journey times from months to days, making regular passenger service between the inner planets commercially viable.

The Orbital Distance & Transit Tables provide detailed information on travel times between various destinations depending on their current orbital positions. Transit duration can vary significantly based on planetary alignment, with travel from Earth to Mars taking anywhere from 85 to 190 hours depending on the Distance Class.

Major passenger lines operate regular service between planets, while smaller independent vessels handle specialized cargo, exploration, and other missions. The Venus Equilateral Station serves as a crucial communication hub, maintaining constant contact with both Earth and Venus regardless of their orbital positions.

## DAILY LIFE

### FOOD AND SUSTENANCE

For most voyages, spacers consume food capsules like the popular brand Fud, which provide all necessary nutrients in pill form while reducing waste processing requirements. Passengers on commercial vessels typically eat real food, with quality proportional to ticket price.

Most inhabitants of civilized areas consume vat-grown meats and hydroponically grown vegetables rather than animal products or soil-grown plants. Terrans particularly favor the efficiency of "pill and paste" meals, while colonists on agricultural worlds like Venus, Ganymede, and Mars prefer traditional farming methods.

Due to either panspermia or Forerunner intervention, proteins and microorganisms throughout the Solar System are largely compatible, allowing humans to safely consume alien foods (with some supplementation recommended for extended periods).

### ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE

Entertainment varies widely across the Solar System, from the regulated pastimes of Terra to the frontier diversions of the outer colonies. Common forms include:

* Holographic recordings of performances and sporting events
* Interactive games ranging from traditional board games to mechanical simulators
* Jetpack races and zero-G sports in low-gravity environments
* Exploration expeditions to uncharted regions
* Cultural performances reflecting the diverse traditions of humanity

Information is primarily stored on paper (often synthetic rather than wood-pulp) and magnetic media. Despite limited storage capacity compared to modern digital systems, physical media remains preferred for its reliability in the face of power failures and magnetic storms.

### SMOKING AND VICES

Modern medical advances have rendered smoking medically safe through proper filters or quarterly lung filter replacement procedures. Cancer and emphysema are easily curable, removing the health risks of tobacco use.

However, smoking remains strictly forbidden aboard spaceships, orbitals, and underwater habitats due to fire risks and the damaging effects of oils and particulates on sensitive equipment. This prohibition has created a cultural divide, with planetside inhabitants taking pride in this freedom denied to spacers.

Popular brands include Meteor Strikes (unfiltered), Sol Malls (highly filtered), and Venus Lights (designed for women), with tobacco grown successfully on both Mars and Venus.

## THE FORERUNNERS

Throughout the Solar System, evidence of a vanished alien civilization known as the Forerunners can be found. These mysterious precursors left behind structures and technology that fundamentally altered the planets, including atmospheric generators that made Mars, Venus, and several moons habitable for human life.

The discovery of Forerunner ruins dramatically altered humanity's religious and philosophical outlook, raising profound questions about our origins and place in the cosmos. Their apparent role in seeding Earth and other worlds with life led many to abandon traditional religions, while others incorporated the Forerunners into existing belief systems.

The only widespread spiritual movement is the Church of Universal Siblinghood (Preĝejo de Universala Gefrateco), which teaches that all sapient beings are siblings and that the rise of sapience is the universe's purpose. This pacifistic organization operates chapter-houses throughout civilized space, providing shelter and meals to those in need.

## ROBOTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Despite significant technological advancement, true artificial intelligence has proven impossible to create. Robots and computers lack self-awareness and volition, simply following orders and suspending operations when not actively engaged.

Robots come in two varieties:

* Smart robots with positronic brains, governed by the Three Laws of Robotics
* Primitive "dumb" robots without positronic brains, limited to controlled environments

On civilized planets, non-positronic robots are strictly limited to areas without human interaction. Most ships carry at least one positronic brain robot as backup for the human crew, regardless of the vessel's size.

The Giant Electronic Brain (GEB) that assists Terra's Science Council and Watson that executes Luna's governmental decisions are both positronic robots, lacking the volition to pursue agendas of their own.
