# **ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES**
## **VOLUME II: OPERATIONS MANUAL**

*Advanced Systems for Gamemasters and Veteran Explorers*

---

## **INTRODUCTION: BEYOND THE BASICS**

Volume I gave you everything needed to create characters and embark on adventures across the atomic-powered solar system. This volume takes you deeper into the intricate systems that power extended campaigns, the advanced mechanics that handle complex situations, and the specialized rules that bring the retrofuturistic world to vivid life.

Here you'll find the detailed systems that experienced Gamemasters rely on: comprehensive combat rules that handle everything from zero-gravity knife fights to atmospheric dogfights over Venus, research procedures that let characters unlock the secrets of ancient Martian artifacts, social contests that make fast-talking and seduction as mechanically interesting as ray gun duels, and chase systems that turn pursuit scenes into white-knuckle adventures worthy of the atomic age.

These aren't rules you need to master before your first game. They're tools to reach for when your campaigns grow more sophisticated, when your players crave mechanical depth, or when the story demands systems that can handle the full scope of atomic-age adventure. Think of this volume as your advanced toolkit, ready to deploy when the situation calls for more than the core mechanics can provide.

The atomic tomorrow is vast and full of possibilities. These systems help you explore them all.

## **CHAPTER 1: MASTERING SPACE AND TIME**

*Orbital mechanics and interplanetary travel in the atomic age*

The solar system of 2025 operates according to the same fundamental laws of physics that have governed planetary motion since Newton first described them, but Chemical X technology has revolutionized how explorers experience the vast distances between worlds. Understanding these distances and their implications will help you create adventures that feel authentically cosmic while maintaining the pacing that keeps stories exciting.

### **THE REALITY OF DISTANCE**

Space is big. Impossibly, mind-numbingly big in ways that challenge human comprehension. Even with Chemical X rockets that can maintain constant acceleration at comfortable gravity levels, journeys between planets take days or weeks rather than minutes or hours. This scale creates unique storytelling opportunities that simply don't exist in terrestrial adventures, at least not since the age of sail.

Distance also means that communication with mission control or outside resources operates under significant delays. A message from Mars to Earth takes between 4 and 22 minutes to arrive, depending on orbital positions. By the time headquarters sends a response, the situation requiring guidance might have evolved dramatically. This forces characters to rely on their own judgment and initiative in ways that create natural dramatic tension.

### **ORBITAL DISTANCE AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS**

Rather than tracking exact astronomical distances, the system uses Distance Classes that represent the current relative positions of planets in their orbits. Planets follow elliptical paths around the sun at different speeds, meaning the distance between any two worlds varies dramatically depending on when you check their positions.

#### **Distance Class Modifiers**

If checking position at the start of a campaign, roll normally. If checking within 1 month of last check, apply -20 to roll if moving toward better class, +20 if moving toward worse class. The Duration column indicates how long the planets remain in this Distance Class before moving to an adjacent class.

#### **PLANETARY PROXIMITY TABLE**

Roll percentile dice (d100) to determine the current relative position between any two planets. The resulting **Distance Class** represents how close or far the planets currently are in their orbits.

| d100 Roll | Position            | Distance Class | Description                     | Duration    |

| 46-55     | Average Position    | D              | Typical distance                | 3d10 days   |
| 56-80     | Unfavorable Angle   | E              | Worse than average distance     | 2d10 days   |
| 81-95     | Far Approach        | F              | Highly unfavorable distance     | 1d10 days   |

#### **The Mercury Advantage**

These tables demonstrate the "Mercury Advantage" that has made it the Solar System's premier trading hub. Mercury has the shortest average travel time to all other planets:

**AVERAGE TRANSIT TIMES (Chemical X)**

| From/To | Earth   | Venus   | Mars    | Jupiter | Average           |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Mercury | 95 hrs  | 95 hrs  | 150 hrs | 295 hrs | **159 hrs** |
| Earth   | -       | 110 hrs | 145 hrs | 275 hrs | **177 hrs** |
| Venus   | 110 hrs | -       | 170 hrs | 320 hrs | **200 hrs** |
| Mars    | 145 hrs | 170 hrs | -       | 280 hrs | **198 hrs** |

Note that these averages account for the fact that most planets spend more time in the unfavorable orbital positions than the optimal ones, so they're not simple average of all the times in the various distance classes.

### **SPECIAL LOCATIONS AND INSTALLATIONS**

Several installations follow carefully calculated orbits that provide specific strategic or economic advantages beyond simple planetary proximity.

#### **Venus Equilateral Station**

One of the most important communication hubs in the system, Venus Equilateral Station maintains a position 60° ahead of Venus in its orbit, forming an equilateral triangle with Venus and the Sun. This position ensures it can maintain constant communication with both Earth and Venus regardless of their orbital positions, while also having line-of-sight to Mercury and Mars for most of their orbits.

#### **L5 Colonies**

The largest human settlement not on a planetary body, the L5 "ELfland" Colony is a pair of counter-rotating cylinders that orbit at the Earth-Moon Lagrange point. Home to slightly under 100,000 people, it serves as a manufacturing center, transit hub, and showcase for space architecture. Its spinning habitats provide Earth-normal gravity for residents.

#### **Hospital Station**

The premier medical facility in space, Hospital Station follows a carefully calculated Mars-Venus cycler orbit that guarantees it's never more than a few days' journey from any point in the inner Solar System. This massive rotating facility houses hundreds of medical specialists, cutting-edge treatment facilities, and research laboratories.

Hospital Station operates on the "fast Venus/slow Mars" cycle, meaning it makes relatively quick transits between Earth and Venus, but takes longer to reach Mars. A second Hospital Station is currently under construction that will follow the complementary "slow Venus/fast Mars" cycle, ensuring that at least one facility will always be optimally positioned for emergency response.

| Current Position                                                        (Check Monthly)|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roll d10: 1-3: Near Venus, 4-6: In transit, 7-9: Near Mars, 0: Near Earth              |

**Travel Times to Hospital Station**

| From Location | Near Venus  | In Transit  | Near Mars   | Near Earth  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Earth         | 60-90 hrs   | 120-180 hrs | 160-200 hrs | 10-30 hrs   |
| Venus         | 10-30 hrs   | 90-150 hrs  | 180-220 hrs | 80-120 hrs  |
| Mars          | 180-220 hrs | 90-150 hrs  | 10-30 hrs   | 170-210 hrs |
| Ceres         | 140-180 hrs | 100-140 hrs | 90-130 hrs  | 160-200 hrs |

### **COMMUNICATION WINDOWS AND DELAYS**

The "Comm Window" row indicates how long a clear communication window typically lasts when relay stations are optimally aligned. Outside these windows, communication requires waiting for the next scheduled window, routing through multiple relay stations (adds 1d10 hours delay), or using emergency broadcast protocols (immediate but extremely limited bandwidth).

### **USING THE ORBITAL SYSTEM IN PLAY**

For a new campaign or after significant time has passed, roll d100 to determine the current Distance Class between any relevant planets. Note the Duration (days) the planets will remain in this position. After that duration, planets will shift one Distance Class (A→B→C→D→E→F→G and then G→F→E→D→C→B→A). Use the Distance Class to determine transit times and communication windows.

Consider the dramatic implications of these limitations in your adventures. Message lag creates tension when characters need immediate guidance. Travel times affect mission planning and create opportunities for situations to evolve while characters are en route. Communication blackouts force characters to make decisions without outside consultation.

Remember that these limitations create dramatic tension and interesting tactical decisions. They're features that enhance your stories, not obstacles to overcome.

## **CHAPTER 2: ADVANCED COMBAT SYSTEMS**

*Handling the complexities of atomic age warfare*

The core combat system handles most conflicts with elegant simplicity, but the atomic age presents challenges that demand more sophisticated responses. Zero-gravity boarding actions where physics work differently, underwater encounters where ray guns become problematic, environmental hazards that turn terrain into an enemy, and vehicular combat where split-second timing determines the difference between victory and expanding debris.

### **ENVIRONMENTAL COMBAT CONDITIONS**

Combat in the atomic age takes place across environments that would have been pure fantasy a century ago. Each presents unique challenges that affect tactics, equipment effectiveness, and survival considerations.

#### **Zero-Gravity Combat**

Fighting in weightless conditions fundamentally changes the nature of physical conflict. Every action produces an equal and opposite reaction, and that reaction can send combatants tumbling helplessly through space if they haven't mastered the principles of zero-gravity movement.

Characters without proper zero-gravity training suffer significant penalties to all physical actions. The Athletics skill expands to include Zero-G Movement specialization, representing formal training in weightless maneuvering techniques. Characters lacking this specialization find their usual combat instincts working against them as powerful attacks send them spinning away from their targets.

High BRAWN scores become potential liabilities in zero gravity. Characters accustomed to using their strength advantage in terrestrial combat discover that forceful movements create momentum they can't control. For every point of BRAWN above 10, characters suffer penalties to Zero-G Movement attempts unless they've received specific training in managing their strength in weightless conditions.

Movement between combat zones requires appropriate equipment or environmental features. Maneuvering jets (ranging from small hand units to comprehensive backpack systems), magnetic grapples, tethers, or simple reaction mass allow controlled movement. Characters can also use weapon recoil for movement, but this requires sacrificing ammunition and provides less precise positioning control.

Standard melee attacks function normally but create movement consequences for both participants unless one combatant has secured themselves to a fixed surface. Projectile weapons maintain their effectiveness but with altered ballistics. Thrown weapons gain extended range but lose stopping power, as momentum conservation means impacts that would knock someone down in gravity might simply send them drifting gracefully backward.

The environment itself becomes a tactical consideration. Hull breaches create suction effects that can draw combatants toward vacuum exposure. Electrical systems damaged during combat might fail catastrophically, creating sparking hazards and potential power losses. Characters who lose contact with their ship or station face the ultimate environmental threat: drifting beyond rescue range into the infinite cold of space.

#### **Underwater Combat**

Venusian seas and the flooded canal systems of Mars present their own tactical challenges. Water changes everything about combat: visibility, movement, weapon effectiveness, and breathing all become factors that can determine survival.

Movement rates drop significantly underwater. Characters must use Athletics (Swimming) for any complex maneuvering, and those without swimming expertise move at quarter normal rate while suffering penalties to all actions. The resistance of water affects both intentional movement and the involuntary displacement caused by weapon impacts.

Weapon effectiveness varies dramatically by type. Ray guns function normally underwater, their energy beams unaffected by the liquid medium. Projectile weapons suffer reduced effectiveness as water resistance slows bullets and alters their trajectories. Melee weapons show interesting variations: edged weapons work normally, while blunt weapons actually gain damage potential from the water's resistance creating additional impact force.

Thrown weapons become nearly useless underwater, with effective ranges reduced to immediate proximity only. The resistance that affects projectile weapons makes throwing weapons impractical beyond the shortest distances, forcing combatants to close to contact range for most interactions.

Environmental factors create additional tactical considerations. Visibility in water rarely exceeds short range in clear conditions and drops to immediate proximity in murky or turbulent water. Breathing apparatus becomes essential for extended underwater encounters, and characters without proper equipment face drowning as a constant threat. Water pressure increases the effectiveness of explosive weapons, amplifying their damage through pressure wave transmission.

#### **Atmospheric Variations**

The diverse atmospheric conditions found throughout the solar system each present unique combat considerations. Venus's crushing atmospheric pressure creates different challenges than the thin air of Mars's highland regions or the carefully controlled environments of space habitats.

High-pressure environments like Venus's surface affect both movement and weapon effectiveness. The dense atmosphere resists rapid movement, reducing overall mobility for all combatants. Explosive weapons gain additional destructive potential as the dense atmosphere transmits pressure waves more effectively. Unprotected characters face immediate physiological threats from atmospheric pressure alone, taking damage each round until they obtain appropriate protection. Sound transmission improves in dense atmospheres, extending perception ranges and making stealth more difficult.

Low-pressure environments create opposite effects. The thin atmospheres of Mars highlands or space station emergencies reduce explosive weapon effectiveness as there's insufficient atmosphere to transmit pressure waves effectively. Thrown weapons gain extended range due to reduced air resistance, while projectile weapons might show improved ballistics. Sound transmission suffers in thin atmospheres, reducing perception ranges and making quiet movement easier. Characters face decompression risks during rapid pressure changes, creating additional medical considerations beyond simple combat injuries.

### **VEHICULAR COMBAT SYSTEMS**

When exploration leads to high-speed pursuits through asteroid fields or dogfights in Jupiter's roiling atmosphere, standard personal combat rules require expansion to handle the different scales of time, distance, and consequence involved. Vehicular combat operates where single mistakes can transform gleaming rocket ships into expanding debris clouds.

#### **Range and Positioning**

Vehicle encounters use range bands that reflect the immense distances involved in space combat. Unlike personal combat's abstract positioning, these ranges have specific tactical implications and determine what actions are possible during each round of conflict.

Formation range represents close enough proximity for boarding actions, ramming attempts, or precise maneuvering around obstacles. This range requires skilled piloting to maintain safely and offers the greatest tactical options but also the highest risk of collision or mutual destruction.

Close range provides effective combat distance for most vehicle weapons while maintaining some safety margin. Medium range restricts combat to long-range weapons only but offers greater maneuverability and escape options. Extended range represents the limits of effective weapon engagement, where escape attempts become possible and visual contact might be intermittent. Beyond this range, pursuit fails and contact is lost.

#### **Pilot Actions and Maneuvers**

Each combat round, pilots choose maneuvers that affect both their tactical position and combat effectiveness. These choices represent the fundamental trade-offs between offensive capability, defensive positioning, and tactical mobility that define vehicular combat.

Evasive maneuvers prioritize survival over offense, making the vehicle a more difficult target while reducing the pilot's ability to line up effective shots. Attack runs sacrifice defensive positioning for improved weapon accuracy, representing the classic fighter pilot tactic of committing to an attack approach despite increased vulnerability. Emergency speed pushes vehicle systems beyond safe parameters for maximum performance, but risks mechanical failure that could end the engagement catastrophically.

Precision flying maintains current positioning while optimizing the pilot's ability to perform technical maneuvers such as docking, navigation through obstacle fields, or coordination with other vehicles. This represents the careful, skilled piloting that exploration missions require when combat effectiveness is less important than mission success.

#### **Damage and System Effects**

Vehicle damage operates differently from personal injury. Rather than wounds that affect overall capability, vehicles accumulate system damage that degrades specific functions. This creates tactical decisions about whether to continue fighting with damaged systems or withdraw for repairs.

Light damage represents superficial hits that affect appearance but don't compromise functionality. These might include hull scoring from near misses, minor component damage, or cosmetic destruction that doesn't affect performance. Light damage accumulates to create maintenance requirements but doesn't impose immediate operational penalties.

Moderate damage begins affecting vehicle performance through specific system degradation. Weapon systems might suffer reduced accuracy or rate of fire. Engine systems could lose maximum speed or maneuverability. Life support damage creates time pressure as environmental systems struggle to maintain crew safety. Each moderate damage result specifies which system is affected and imposes operational penalties until repairs are completed.

Heavy damage represents serious system compromise that significantly affects vehicle capability while creating cascade failure risks. Damaged systems might function unpredictably, fail at crucial moments, or create secondary damage to other vehicle components. Heavy damage often forces tactical withdrawal unless the engagement can be concluded quickly.

Critical damage indicates system failure with potential for catastrophic consequences. Weapon systems might explode rather than firing, engines could detonate, and life support failure threatens crew survival. Critical damage often requires immediate response to prevent vehicle destruction and crew casualties.

## **CHAPTER 3: CHASE SYSTEMS**

*High-speed pursuit in the atomic age*

Nothing captures the atomic age's sense of adventure like high-speed pursuit through neon-lit canyons of Luna City or desperate races across Martian crystal deserts with security forces closing fast. The chase system transforms these cinematic moments into tactical challenges where split-second decisions and daring maneuvers determine whether heroes escape to adventure another day.

### **DISTANCE TRACKING AND RESOLUTION**

Chase encounters use a simple distance-tracking system that captures the dynamic nature of pursuit without requiring complex position mapping. The current separation between pursuer and quarry determines what actions are possible and creates natural dramatic tension as the gap opens or closes.

Distance ranges from immediate contact where ramming and boarding actions become possible, through close range where direct weapon fire is effective, to extended range where visual contact might be lost and escape becomes achievable. Each range increment represents a significant change in tactical options and dramatic tension.

Each round, both pilots make skill rolls modified by their vehicle's capabilities and environmental conditions. Success allows the pilot to attempt their desired maneuver: closing distance, opening range, or maintaining current separation while performing other actions. The difference between success margins determines how much the distance changes and whether any special maneuvers succeed.

This system emphasizes pilot skill and tactical decision-making over vehicle statistics alone. A skilled pilot in an inferior vehicle can often outmaneuver superior opponents through clever use of terrain, superior planning, or willingness to take risks that more cautious pursuers won't attempt.

### **ENVIRONMENTAL CHASE CONDITIONS**

Different environments create unique tactical considerations that affect pursuit strategies and optimal vehicle choices. Master pilots learn to use environmental conditions to their advantage while avoiding the hazards that can end chases through catastrophic collision rather than successful escape.

#### **Urban Environments**

Dense city streets, spaceport traffic corridors, and industrial complexes provide cover and obstacles that favor smaller, more maneuverable vehicles over raw speed and power. Urban chases become exercises in precision flying and quick decision-making as pilots navigate through spaces barely wider than their vehicles.

Small vehicles gain significant advantages in urban environments through their ability to use spaces and routes unavailable to larger craft. Narrow alleys, building overhangs, and complex traffic patterns create opportunities for evasive maneuvers that larger vehicles simply cannot attempt. However, urban environments also provide opportunities for larger vehicles to use their size and power advantages through ramming tactics and brute-force approaches that smaller craft must avoid.

Obstacle hazards require constant attention as pilots navigate through spaces designed for much slower traffic. Civilian vehicles, building structures, and infrastructure elements create collision risks that affect all participants equally. Urban environments also provide concealment opportunities through traffic patterns, building shadows, and the complex visual backgrounds that make target tracking more difficult.

The complexity of urban environments rewards local knowledge and navigation expertise. Pilots familiar with specific cities can exploit shortcuts, traffic patterns, and architectural features that provide advantages over pursuers unfamiliar with local conditions. This creates opportunities for characters to use their background knowledge as tactical assets during chase encounters.

#### **Open Terrain**

Martian deserts, lunar maria, and deep space expanses favor vehicles with superior speed and endurance over maneuverability and concealment options. Open terrain chases become tests of vehicle performance and pilot endurance rather than navigation skill and tactical positioning.

Top speed becomes the primary factor determining chase outcomes in open terrain. Without obstacles to limit maximum velocity or provide concealment opportunities, the chase often reduces to which vehicle can maintain higher speeds for longer periods. This emphasizes vehicle selection and maintenance considerations that might be less important in other environments.

Extended chases become possible over vast distances without the termination risks that obstacles and traffic provide. This can create tension through resource management as fuel consumption, mechanical stress, and crew endurance become factors in determining chase outcomes. Pilots must balance immediate speed needs against long-term sustainability.

Environmental hazards in open terrain affect all participants equally rather than providing tactical advantages. Dust storms on Mars, solar flare activity in space, or seismic activity on planetary surfaces create challenges that both pursuers and quarry must overcome. These hazards can dramatically alter chase dynamics by forcing temporary alliances, creating natural breaks in pursuit, or providing cover that allows tactical repositioning.

#### **Hazardous Environments**

Asteroid fields, atmospheric storm systems, and unstable terrain add environmental threats that can be more dangerous than the opposition. These environments require pilots to balance pursuit objectives against survival considerations as the terrain itself becomes an active threat.

Navigation skill becomes crucial for avoiding environmental damage that can end chases through collision, system failure, or catastrophic environmental exposure. Pilots must constantly evaluate whether continued pursuit is worth the risks involved, creating natural tension between mission objectives and personal safety.

Some standard maneuvers become impossible or extremely dangerous in hazardous environments. High-speed turns might be impossible near gravitational anomalies, electronic systems might fail in radiation fields, and visual navigation could become unreliable in dust storms or energy discharges. These limitations force pilots to adapt their tactics to environmental conditions.

Environmental hazards create opportunities for skilled pilots to use terrain advantages against less experienced opponents. A pilot familiar with asteroid field navigation might deliberately lead pursuit through particularly dangerous regions, counting on superior skill to navigate safely while hoping pursuers will be forced to break off or suffer environmental damage.

Both pursuers and quarry face equal risks from environmental hazards, but experience and preparation can provide significant advantages. Characters with appropriate specialization, environmental knowledge, or properly equipped vehicles can operate safely in conditions that force other pilots to reduce speed or abandon pursuit entirely.

### **SPECIAL MANEUVERS AND TACTICS**

Experienced pilots develop advanced techniques that can turn the tide of pursuit through spectacular displays of skill or calculated risks that catch opponents unprepared. These maneuvers represent the difference between competent piloting and the legendary flying that creates atomic age heroes.

#### **Bootlegger's Turn**

This dramatic reversal swings the vehicle around to face pursuers directly, instantly transforming a fleeing quarry into an aggressive pursuer. The maneuver requires exceptional piloting skill and perfect timing, but successful execution can completely reverse chase dynamics and catch opponents off-guard.

The maneuver works by using momentum and careful control surface management to reverse direction without losing significant speed. Success allows the pilot to maintain most of their velocity while ending up on a reciprocal heading, effectively turning pursuit into a head-on engagement where both vehicles are closing rapidly.

Failed attempts result in loss of control and potential vehicle damage as the pilot attempts maneuvers beyond their skill level or their vehicle's capabilities. The risks involved make bootlegger's turns desperate measures that experienced pilots reserve for situations where continued flight offers no better alternatives.

Successful bootlegger's turns create immediate tactical decisions for pursuers who suddenly find themselves flying directly toward an opponent they were previously following. Pursuers must decide whether to continue their approach for a head-on engagement, attempt their own reversal maneuver, or break off to avoid collision.

#### **Threading the Needle**

This technique uses obstacles or tight spaces to lose pursuit by going where larger vehicles cannot follow. Success provides major distance advantages while demonstrating superior piloting skill, but failure often means collision with whatever obstacle the pilot attempted to use for concealment.

The maneuver requires precise navigation through spaces barely wider than the vehicle itself, using size advantages to access routes unavailable to pursuers. Urban environments, asteroid fields, and complex terrain features provide opportunities for needle-threading attempts by pilots confident in their navigation abilities.

Successful execution often ends pursuit immediately as larger vehicles find themselves unable to follow and must either abandon chase or attempt time-consuming alternate routes. The distance gained during these detours usually allows quarry to escape completely or reach safe haven before pursuit can resume.

Risk assessment becomes crucial for needle-threading attempts. Pilots must evaluate obstacle spacing, approach angles, and their own vehicle's dimensional requirements under dynamic conditions while managing the stress of active pursuit. Miscalculation often results in collision damage that eliminates any advantage the maneuver might have provided.

Environmental knowledge provides significant advantages for needle-threading tactics. Pilots familiar with specific obstacle fields, urban layouts, or terrain features can plan threading routes in advance rather than attempting improvised navigation during active pursuit. This preparation often means the difference between successful evasion and catastrophic collision.

#### **Systems Overload**

Pushing vehicle systems beyond safe operational parameters provides temporary performance boosts that can create crucial advantages during critical chase moments. The technique requires technical knowledge to implement safely and acceptance of mechanical risks that could end the chase through system failure rather than successful resolution.

Overload techniques vary by system and vehicle type. Engine overloads provide speed or acceleration boosts but risk catastrophic mechanical failure. Weapon system overloads might provide increased damage output or rate of fire at the cost of system reliability. Navigation system overloads can enhance sensor capability or processing speed while risking total system crashes that leave pilots flying blind.

The technique is only available to characters with appropriate technical expertise who understand their vehicle's systems well enough to push them safely beyond normal limits. Attempting overloads without proper knowledge often results in immediate system failure rather than enhanced performance.

Duration limitations prevent overload techniques from becoming universal solutions to pursuit problems. Most systems can only sustain overload conditions for brief periods before either succeeding in their enhanced performance or failing completely. This creates tactical timing decisions about when to commit to overload attempts for maximum advantage.

Recovery considerations affect post-overload operations regardless of initial success. Systems that survive overload periods often require immediate maintenance attention to prevent delayed failures. Pilots must balance immediate tactical needs against longer-term operational requirements, especially during extended missions where immediate maintenance isn't available.

### **CHASE SYSTEM PLAY EXAMPLE**

**Scenario**: Captain Rex "Hotshot" Morrison is fleeing through the neon-lit canyons of Luna City in his nimble scout ship *Stardust* after stealing crucial intelligence data. Behind him, two Security Force interceptors are closing fast through the crowded traffic corridors.

**Setup**: 
- Rex's *Stardust* (Nimble +20%, TH 2 standard thrust)
- Security Interceptors (Standard maneuverability, TH 3 +20% thrust)
- Current Range: Close (interceptors gaining ground)
- Environment: Urban Luna City (+20% to small vehicles, obstacles everywhere)

**Round 1 - Opening the Gap**
**Rex (Pilot)**: "Time to show these flatfoots what real flying looks like!" 

*Rex attempts evasive maneuvering using Pilot (75% +20% nimble +20% urban = 115%, max 95%)*
*Lead Interceptor uses Pursuit (65% +20% thrust = 85%)*

*Rex rolls 15 - Critical Success (doubles under skill)*
*Lead Interceptor rolls 52 - Ordinary Success*

**GM**: "Rex throws the *Stardust* into a spiraling dive between two cargo haulers, using their bulk to break sensor lock. The lead interceptor follows but can't match your precision."

*Range: Close → Medium (+3 for critical vs +1 for ordinary = +2 range increase)*

**Round 2 - Threading the Needle**
**Rex**: "There - the maintenance tunnel under Sector 7! They'll never fit their fat interceptors through there!"

*Rex attempts "Threading the Needle" maneuver at -20% difficulty (Urban environment, tight space)*
*Rex rolls Pilot (75% +20% nimble +20% urban -20% needle = 95%)*

*Rex rolls 35 - Special Success (ends in 5)*

**GM**: "The *Stardust* barely fits through the narrow maintenance tunnel, scraping sparks off both walls! The interceptors are forced to take the long way around."

*Range: Medium → Extended (+2 for special success + automatic bonus for successful needle-threading)*

**Round 3 - Systems Overload**
**Lead Interceptor Pilot**: "Control, we're losing them! Engaging emergency thrust!"

*Interceptor attempts engine overload with Engineering skill*
*Rex continues evasive flying*

*Rex rolls 67 - Ordinary Success*
*Interceptor rolls overload: Success, but must check for system damage later*
*Interceptor pursuit: 89 - Failure (overload didn't help enough)*

**GM**: "The interceptor's engines scream as they push beyond safe limits, but your head start through the tunnel is too much. You watch their engine signatures fade on your rear sensors."

*Range: Extended → Beyond Contact (Rex escapes)*

**Captain Morrison**: "Another successful data liberation courtesy of Hotshot Morrison! Luna City Security really needs better pilots."

**Result**: Rex's combination of superior maneuvering, environmental knowledge, and willingness to take risks allowed his smaller ship to outrun more powerful pursuers through skill rather than raw speed.

## **CHAPTER 4: RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION**

*Unlocking the mysteries of the atomic age*

The atomic tomorrow contains mysteries that demand systematic investigation: ancient Martian artifacts that respond to human consciousness, energy readings that don't match known physics, alien communication patterns that might represent intelligence, and technological principles that could revolutionize human understanding of the universe. The research system provides frameworks for discovering these secrets through careful observation, experimentation, and analysis.

### **THE RESEARCH CARD SYSTEM**

For complex investigations requiring sustained effort over multiple sessions—such as analyzing alien artifacts, developing new technologies, or understanding exotic phenomena—use the Research Card System. This framework transforms extended research into structured challenges with meaningful choices and dramatic complications.

#### **Research Approaches**

Every investigation can be approached through four distinct methodologies, each using different skills and resources:

**♥️ HEARTS: INTUITIVE/PSYCHIC APPROACH**
- Skills: Psi abilities, NERVE checks, Perception (Intuition)
- Resource: Psi Crystals (amplify psionic impressions)

**♦️ DIAMONDS: SCIENTIFIC APPROACH**
- Skills: Science specializations, Investigation (Analysis), Computer Systems
- Resource: Reference Materials (journals, manuals, databases)

**♣️ CLUBS: TECHNICAL/ENGINEERING APPROACH**  

- Skills: Engineering, Technology, Repair
- Resource: Spare Components (circuit elements, mechanical parts)

**♠️ SPADES: HISTORICAL/CULTURAL APPROACH**

- Skills: History, Anthropology, Language, Art
- Resource: Historical Records (cultural archives, linguistic databases)

#### **Research Point Accumulation**

Characters accumulate Research Points through skill checks using their chosen approach:

- **Critical Success**: 3 Research Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Research Points  
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Research Point
- **Special Failure**: Research tangent (draw random complication)
- **Critical Failure**: Major setback, lose progress on current node

**Extra Success Options**: When you get Special or Critical Success, excess Research Points can be spent as:
- **Standard**: Extra points toward clearing current research node
- **ANALYSIS**: Reveal next research card without drawing it (1 point per peek)
- **HYPOTHESIS**: Discard a revealed card - draw replacement (1 point per discard)  
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Store up to 5 Research Points for current approach (1:1)

#### **Research Progression**

Research uses a card-based system that creates both visible and hidden research tracks:

**Initial Setup**: GM draws cards until finding one that matches the current research approach, placing non-matching cards face-down in separate rows by suit to create hidden alternative tracks.

**Player Choice Each Turn**: Researchers decide between:
- Working on the revealed matching card (known difficulty)
- Exploring a hidden track by flipping the top card of any face-down row (unknown difficulty)

**Primary Research Cards** (same approach): Must accumulate Research Points equal to card value to clear the research node.

**Secondary Research Cards** (different approaches) create outcomes based on value comparison:

**HIGHER VALUE** = *Cross-Disciplinary Insight*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Intuitive breakthrough - gain +1 Research Point toward current node
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Scientific validation - reduce current node requirement by 1
- **♣️ Clubs**: Practical application - next skill roll gets +20% bonus
- **♠️ Spades**: Historical context - reveal next card without drawing it

**EXACT MATCH** = *Perfect Synthesis*
- Any approach: Immediately gain +2 Research Points AND reduce node requirement by 1

**LOWER VALUE** = *Methodological Conflict*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Conflicting intuitions - make NERVE check or lose 1 Research Point
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Data contradiction - choose: spend 1 Reference Material or -20% to next roll
- **♣️ Clubs**: Technical incompatibility - must clear before continuing (costs 1 Research Point)
- **♠️ Spades**: Cultural misunderstanding - current approach locked until node complete

#### **Research Failure Conditions**

Research permanently stalls when ANY of the following occurs:

**THEORETICAL DEAD END**
- After 15 failed skill rolls on a single research node
- **Narrative**: "This approach has been exhausted - you need a fundamentally different perspective"
- **Game Effect**: Current node becomes "burned out" - cannot be approached via this methodology again
- **Options**: Must switch to different research approach or seek outside expertise

**RESOURCE DEPLETION**
- When research resources are exhausted (20 total limit per research project)
- **Narrative**: "You've exhausted all available materials and references"
- **Game Effect**: Cannot handle complications or reduce node requirements
- **Options**: Continue with skill rolls only, or seek additional funding/resources

**PARADIGM COLLAPSE**
- When the next same-approach card is ≥4 values higher than current node
- **Narrative**: "Your assumptions are fundamentally flawed - continuing risks invalidating all previous work"
- **Game Effect**: Immediate research failure; must start over with different approach
- **Prevention**: Use ANALYSIS to spot dangerous sequences, HYPOTHESIS to discard them

**CASCADE CONFUSION**
- Drawing 3 consecutive Jacks triggers theoretical incoherence
- **Narrative**: "Multiple contradictions have created an unresolvable paradox"
- **Game Effect**: All previous research becomes suspect; requires peer review to salvage anything
- **Prevention**: Use HYPOTHESIS to discard Jack complications when possible

#### **Research Resource Management**

**Reference Materials**: Reduce required Research Points by 1-3 depending on quality
**Atomic Power Cells**: Enable psychic research approaches and amplify intuitive insights
**Spare Components**: Allow hands-on experimentation and prototype construction
**Historical Records**: Provide cultural context and prevent misinterpretation
**Resource Limit**: Maximum 20 total resources per research project
**Collaborative Research**: Assistants can contribute expertise and provide additional resource access

#### **Research Examples**

**Studying Mysterious Martian Cube (Threshold 6)**

**Initial Draw**: GM draws until finding Scientific approach match: 2♠, 7♣, 6♦
- Places 2♠ and 7♣ face-down in Spades and Clubs rows
- Reveals 6♦ as visible option requiring 6 Research Points

**Player Decision**: Team sees the 6♦ meets their threshold 6 requirement and chooses to work on it rather than risk unknown hidden tracks.

**Research Continues**: Team accumulates points through Science checks and resource spending.

**Next Draw**: GM draws cards until finding match: 4♠, K♥, 3♦
- 4♠ added to Spades row, K♥ to Hearts row (special event noted)
- 3♦ revealed as next option

**Player Decision**: Seeing the easier 3♦, team works on visible card rather than exploring hidden alternatives.

**Alternative Scenario**: If team had explored Clubs row earlier, they would have found 7♣ - a harder challenge but potentially leading to different insights about the cube's engineering.

**Research Success**: Team completes their investigation, understanding both the cube's archaeological significance and its practical applications!

## **CHAPTER 5: PLANETARY EXPLORATION SYSTEMS**

*Mapping the unknown territories of the atomic frontier*

The solar system of 2025 remains largely unmapped despite humanity's atomic-powered expansion among the worlds. Each planet contains vast regions where only the most preliminary surveys have established basic topography, leaving countless opportunities for discovery that can shape entire civilizations. The exploration card system provides frameworks for generating meaningful terrain encounters, managing the drama of discovery, and handling the complex relationship between visibility, navigation, and the constant tension between wonder and danger that defines frontier expeditions.

Planetary exploration operates fundamentally differently from terrestrial adventure because of scale, isolation, and the exotic conditions found throughout the solar system. A single wrong decision can strand expeditions hundreds of millions of miles from rescue, while successful discoveries might revolutionize human understanding of alien worlds. The card-based exploration system captures these stakes while generating the variety and unpredictability that makes each expedition unique.

### **VISIBILITY AND TERRAIN INTERACTION**

The fundamental challenge of exploration lies in determining what explorers can perceive from their current position and how environmental conditions affect their ability to plan ahead. Different terrain types dramatically affect visibility ranges, which in turn determines how much information explorers have when making crucial navigation decisions.

**Low Visibility Terrain** includes dense jungles, deep canyons, areas of persistent fog or atmospheric disturbance, and any environment where sight lines are severely restricted. In these areas, explorers can only determine what exists in their immediate hex, forcing them to make navigation decisions based on limited information and requiring careful attention to landmarks, natural pathways, and other guidance systems.

**Standard Visibility Terrain** covers most common environments including plains, deserts, hills, and areas with moderate elevation changes. From these positions, explorers can observe notable features in one direction beyond their current location, providing enough information to make informed decisions about their next movement while maintaining the uncertainty that drives exploration drama.

**High Visibility Terrain** encompasses mountain peaks, observation towers, elevated plateaus, and any position that provides commanding views of surrounding territory. From these advantageous positions, explorers can observe features in multiple directions, gaining strategic understanding of regional layout while revealing multiple potential destinations for further investigation.

### **THE FEATURE CARD SYSTEM**

Feature cards represent the distinctive landmarks, geographical formations, and points of interest that guide exploration decisions and create memorable discoveries. Rather than generating random terrain without context, feature cards ensure that every vista contains something worth investigating while providing the variety necessary for sustained exploration campaigns.

Each feature card shows specific observable elements that explorers can identify from a distance. Features might include natural formations like crystal clusters or waterfalls, artificial structures like abandoned outposts or ancient ruins, biological phenomena like unusual plant growth or animal congregations, or atmospheric conditions like thermal vents or electromagnetic anomalies.

The cards serve multiple purposes in exploration sequences. They provide immediate navigation goals that give players clear choices about where to direct their expeditions. They create anticipation as players approach visible features, wondering what details will be revealed upon closer investigation. They ensure that exploration sequences maintain forward momentum rather than devolving into aimless wandering through empty terrain.

**Card Drawing Protocol**: Draw feature cards only when visibility conditions permit observation beyond the current hex. Position cards to indicate the relative direction of visible features, allowing explorers to make informed decisions about which direction offers the most promising opportunities for investigation.

**Feature Investigation**: When explorers move toward a visible feature, they arrive at the corresponding hex where the feature can be investigated thoroughly. At this point, you might draw additional opportunity or hazard cards to determine what happens when the feature is explored in detail, creating layered discovery experiences that reward careful investigation.

### **EXPLORATION SEQUENCE MANAGEMENT**

Effective exploration requires balancing the desire for comprehensive discovery against practical limitations like supply consumption, equipment durability, and mission timeframes. The exploration system provides structure for managing these competing demands while maintaining the dramatic pacing that keeps exploration engaging rather than tedious.

**Entry Phase**: When explorers enter a new hex, establish terrain type based on planetary conditions and regional characteristics. Roll on appropriate terrain generation tables to determine basic environmental features, then assess visibility conditions to determine what feature cards should be drawn.

**Assessment Phase**: Present visible features to players and allow them to discuss their options. This creates natural decision points where players must weigh the potential value of different discoveries against factors like distance, apparent difficulty, and how investigation fits into their overall mission parameters.

**Movement Phase**: Players choose their next destination based on available information. Movement toward visible features provides clear direction, while movement into unexplored territory requires navigation checks and creates opportunities for unexpected discoveries or complications that weren't visible from previous positions.

**Investigation Phase**: When explorers arrive at features they observed from a distance, provide detailed descriptions and opportunities for thorough investigation. This is where feature cards transition from navigation aids to specific encounter opportunities that might trigger opportunity or hazard cards for detailed resolution.

### **NAVIGATION AND WAYFINDING**

The atomic age provides explorers with sophisticated navigation tools, but planetary conditions often limit their effectiveness in ways that create interesting challenges and preserve the fundamental uncertainties that make exploration dramatically compelling.

Standard navigation equipment includes planetary positioning systems, magnetic compasses (where applicable), and stellar navigation tools. However, dense atmospheres block satellite signals, magnetic anomalies confuse compass readings, and perpetual cloud cover prevents stellar navigation. These limitations force explorers to rely on landmark navigation, indigenous guidance systems, and natural phenomena for orientation.

**Landmark Navigation** uses distinctive terrain features to establish position and direction. Crystal formations, unusual geological structures, and artificial constructions serve as reference points that explorers can identify from multiple positions. The feature card system supports landmark navigation by ensuring that distinctive features appear regularly in exploration sequences.

**Indigenous Systems** represent navigation methods developed by native populations or previous expeditions. These might include trail markers, natural sign reading, biological indicators like animal migration patterns, or cultural systems like sacred site networks that provide orientation frameworks across large regions.

**Natural Phenomena** include river systems, prevailing wind patterns, geological formations, and other environmental features that provide directional reference. Venus's extensive waterways offer reliable navigation corridors, while Mars's ancient canal system provides a planetary-scale framework for orientation even when individual canals have long since dried.

### **SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND EXPEDITION PLANNING**

Successful exploration depends on careful resource management that balances thorough investigation against the practical limitations of finite supplies and equipment durability. The exploration system provides guidelines for tracking supply consumption while avoiding the tedious bookkeeping that can slow game pacing.

**Supply Point System**: Rather than tracking individual items, use abstracted Supply Points that represent the expedition's overall resource status. Different activities consume supplies at different rates, with careful exploration consuming resources more slowly than forced marches or emergency situations.

**Equipment Durability**: Exploration equipment gradually degrades through normal use and environmental exposure. The atomic age provides remarkably reliable technology, but even the best equipment requires maintenance and eventually replacement when subjected to the harsh conditions found throughout the solar system.

**Emergency Procedures**: When expeditions encounter unexpected complications—equipment failures, hostile encounters, severe weather, or navigation errors—emergency protocols help maintain expedition capability while creating dramatic tension around resource allocation decisions.

### **THE EXPLORATION CARD SYSTEM**

The exploration card system operates through a structured sequence that transforms terrain generation from random rolling into meaningful decision-making opportunities. This framework ensures that every exploration sequence provides clear navigation choices while maintaining the unpredictability that makes discovery exciting.

#### **Terrain Generation and Card Drawing**

**Step 1: Hex Entry and Terrain Establishment**
When explorers enter a new hex, roll on appropriate terrain generation tables to determine basic environmental characteristics. Place a terrain index card to mark this hex on your growing map, noting terrain type, basic features, and any special characteristics that affect movement or visibility.

**Step 2: Visibility Assessment and Feature Card Drawing**
Based on terrain type, determine visibility conditions and draw appropriate feature cards:

- **Low Visibility Terrain**: Draw no feature cards. Explorers can only perceive what exists in their immediate hex and must rely on ground-level navigation cues like trails, water flow, or indigenous markers.

- **Standard Visibility Terrain**: Draw one feature card and position it to indicate the direction of the visible feature. This card shows what explorers can observe in one direction beyond their current position.

- **High Visibility Terrain**: Draw one feature card for each "forward" direction that explorers can observe. Position cards to indicate relative directions of visible features, providing strategic overview of regional opportunities.

**Step 3: Feature Presentation and Player Choice**
Present visible features to players, describing what they can observe from their current position. Allow players to discuss their options and choose which direction offers the most promising opportunities for investigation or best serves their mission objectives.

#### **Feature Card Mechanics**

Each feature card represents specific observable elements that provide navigation targets and investigation opportunities. Cards should be positioned relative to the explorers' current hex to indicate direction, creating visual representations of available exploration choices.   As the players explore and feature cards are drawn lay them out in staggered rows, so each card is adjacent to one card to the left and right, and two cards each in the top and bottom directions, creating a "hex" with 6 potential exits from each location.

**Card Positioning**: Place feature cards around the current hex card to show directional relationships. This visual arrangement helps players understand their options while providing you with clear reference for which direction leads to which discoveries. When the players choose to enter the area represented by the card, replace it with a blank index card. Scribble onto the newly added card the salient feature of the feature card, and as the players interact with that area additional notes can be added to the growing map, for instance any natives, settlers or structures they find as they explore.

**Card Reuse**: Feature cards can be reused throughout campaigns as the same types of features appear in different contexts. A "crystal formation" card might represent different formations on different worlds, but the basic navigation and investigation opportunities remain consistent.

**Multiple Features**: High visibility positions allow observation of multiple features simultaneously. Position multiple cards around the current hex to show all visible options, creating strategic decision points where players must choose between competing opportunities.

#### **Investigation and Discovery Resolution**

When explorers move toward a visible feature, they arrive at the corresponding hex where detailed investigation becomes possible. This creates a two-stage discovery process where distant observation creates anticipation and closer investigation provides detailed resolution.

**Feature Resolution**: Upon arrival at a feature hex, provide detailed descriptions of what explorers find. The feature that was visible from a distance becomes the central element of the new hex, but closer investigation reveals additional details not apparent from afar.

**Opportunity and Hazard Integration**: Use opportunity and hazard cards to determine what happens when features are investigated thoroughly. A crystal formation might trigger an opportunity card revealing valuable materials, while a seemingly peaceful clearing might trigger a hazard card indicating territorial wildlife.

**Exploration Momentum**: Each feature investigation should reveal new visible features when visibility conditions permit, maintaining exploration momentum while ensuring that every discovery opens new possibilities rather than creating dead ends.

#### **Hex Scale and Movement Rates**

Different planetary conditions require adjusted hex scales that reflect both visibility limitations and movement capabilities under varying gravitational and atmospheric conditions.

**Planetary Hex Scales**:
- **Earth**: 2 miles (baseline reference)
- **Venus**: 1 mile (dense vegetation limits visibility)
- **Mars**: 3 miles (low gravity increases range, clear air improves visibility)
- **Mercury**: 4 miles (excellent visibility but extreme conditions)

**Daily Movement Rates**:
Travel rates depend on terrain difficulty, planetary conditions, and available transportation methods. Base rates assume careful exploration rather than forced marches, accounting for the investigation time that makes exploration worthwhile.

**Venus Movement Rates**:
- Highland terrain: 2-3 hexes per day on foot
- River travel: 4-6 hexes per day following waterways
- Hovercraft: 5-7 hexes per day in cleared areas

**Mars Movement Rates**:
- Open terrain: 4-6 hexes per day on foot (low gravity benefit)
- Canal routes: 5-7 hexes per day following ancient waterways
- Ground vehicles: 8-12 hexes per day on established paths

#### **Example Exploration Sequence**

**GM**: "Your expedition has reached a highland plateau on Venus. This is standard visibility terrain." *Draws one feature card and positions it northeast of current hex* "From this elevated position, you can see a cluster of violet crystals catching the filtered sunlight about two kilometers to the northeast. The crystals appear to be growing from a natural rock formation."

**Player 1**: "Those crystals might be valuable. Let's head that way and investigate."

**GM**: "You travel northeast through highland jungle terrain. After about three hours of hiking, you arrive at the crystal formation." *Places new terrain card for crystal hex* "Up close, you can see the crystals are about twice your height and emit a faint harmonic vibration when the wind passes through them."

*Draws opportunity card for thorough investigation*

**GM**: "While examining the formation, you discover that the crystals have unusual acoustic properties. A Science check could determine if they have practical applications for communication equipment."

**Player 2**: "I'll make the Science check while keeping watch for anything dangerous."

*Player rolls Science check successfully*

**GM**: "The crystals resonate at frequencies that could amplify standard radio signals. You could harvest enough material to enhance your communication gear's range significantly." *Since this is still standard visibility terrain, draws new feature card* "From this position, you can also see what appears to be an abandoned research shelter about a kilometer to the west, partially hidden by large flowering plants."

This sequence demonstrates how feature cards create navigation goals, investigation opportunities, and forward momentum while maintaining the dramatic pacing that keeps exploration engaging.

## **CHAPTER 6: SOCIAL CONFLICTS AND NEGOTIATIONS**

*The art of persuasion in the atomic tomorrow*

The atomic age operates on grand scales that make personal relationships and social influence crucial factors in determining outcomes. A well-timed conversation with the right person can open doors across the solar system, while social missteps can close opportunities that might never arise again. The social conflict system provides frameworks for handling complex negotiations, diplomatic missions, and interpersonal challenges that require more depth than simple skill rolls.

### **STRUCTURED NEGOTIATION SYSTEMS**

Complex negotiations require systematic approaches that account for multiple parties, competing interests, and the long-term relationship consequences that extend far beyond immediate agreements. The structured negotiation system breaks complex discussions into manageable phases while maintaining dramatic tension and meaningful character choices.

Preparation phases allow characters to research their counterparts, understand underlying interests, and develop negotiation strategies based on available information. Success during preparation often determines whether subsequent negotiation phases proceed smoothly or encounter unexpected complications. Characters who invest time in understanding their negotiation partners find themselves better equipped to find mutually acceptable solutions.

Opening positions establish each party's initial stance and the general framework for subsequent discussions. This phase often involves strategic positioning as participants attempt to anchor expectations while maintaining flexibility for later compromises. Characters with strong social skills can use opening statements to frame negotiations in ways that favor their objectives.

Information exchange allows parties to share relevant facts, clarify assumptions, and identify areas of common ground or irreconcilable differences. This phase rewards characters with technical expertise who can provide credible information that supports their positions. Honesty during information exchange builds trust that facilitates later agreement, while deception creates risks of discovery that can derail entire negotiations.

Bargaining phases involve the give-and-take of offer and counteroffer as parties work toward mutually acceptable agreements. Success depends on characters' ability to identify creative solutions that address multiple parties' core interests. Characters must balance firmness on essential points with flexibility on secondary issues to maintain negotiation momentum.

Agreement finalization requires careful attention to implementation details, verification procedures, and contingency planning for changed circumstances. Characters who neglect this phase often find that apparent agreements fall apart when participants attempt to put them into practice. Clear understanding of expectations and responsibilities prevents later disputes that can damage relationships.

### **DIPLOMATIC PROTOCOL AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**

The atomic age brings together cultures that have developed under wildly different conditions: Earth societies with their ancient traditions, colonial communities adapted to alien environments, and potentially non-human intelligences with completely different social assumptions. Successful diplomacy requires understanding and respecting these differences while finding common ground for cooperation.

Cultural research becomes essential preparation for diplomatic missions as social norms vary dramatically between different human communities and even more between species. What constitutes polite behavior on Earth might be deeply offensive to Martian colonial societies. Gestures, vocal tones, and personal space expectations all carry cultural significance that diplomats must understand to avoid inadvertent insults.

Protocol awareness helps diplomats navigate the formal structures that govern inter-group relationships. Different societies have developed various approaches to status recognition, authority structures, and decision-making processes. Understanding these protocols allows diplomats to work within established systems rather than accidentally violating procedural expectations.

Translation challenges go beyond simple language differences to include conceptual frameworks that might not exist across cultural boundaries. Some ideas that are fundamental to one society might have no equivalent in another's thinking. Skilled diplomats learn to find metaphors and explanations that bridge these conceptual gaps without losing essential meaning.

Non-verbal communication carries different meanings across cultures and species. Facial expressions, body language, and social positioning all communicate information that varies between societies. Diplomats must learn to read these signals accurately while controlling their own non-verbal communication to avoid sending unintended messages.

Relationship building extends beyond immediate negotiation objectives to establish ongoing connections that facilitate future cooperation. The atomic age's vast distances and communication delays make maintaining relationships challenging, but successful diplomats invest in personal connections that survive temporal and spatial separation.

### **FIRST CONTACT PROCEDURES**

Establishing communication with non-human intelligences presents unique challenges that go beyond cultural diplomacy between human societies. First contact situations require careful balance between scientific curiosity, diplomatic caution, and safety considerations as characters navigate completely unknown social and psychological landscapes.

Communication establishment begins with attempts to demonstrate intelligence and peaceful intent through mathematical concepts, physical demonstrations, or other universal principles that might transcend species barriers. Characters must find ways to initiate meaningful exchange without making assumptions about alien sensory capabilities or cognitive processes.

Intent clarification seeks to understand whether alien contact represents curiosity, formal diplomacy, territorial assertion, or other motivations that might affect human responses. This often requires careful observation of alien behavior patterns and attempts to interpret actions within alien cultural contexts that humans don't yet understand.

Safety protocols ensure that first contact procedures don't inadvertently create dangers for human personnel or alien contacts. Unknown technologies, biological incompatibilities, psychological effects, or defensive mechanisms might pose threats that aren't immediately apparent. Characters must balance contact objectives against prudent caution.

Information gathering attempts to understand alien capabilities, social structures, technological level, and potential interests that might form the basis for ongoing relationships. This requires systematic observation and careful questioning that respects alien privacy while gathering essential information for policy decisions.

Relationship establishment moves beyond initial contact toward ongoing communication frameworks that can survive misunderstandings, cultural differences, and the practical challenges of maintaining contact across space and time. Success often determines whether first contact leads to beneficial cooperation or deteriorates into conflict.

### **CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL POLITICS**

The atomic age's rapid expansion has created complex institutional relationships that often determine resource allocation, research priorities, and exploration opportunities. Characters who understand these political dynamics can navigate institutional structures more effectively while avoiding the pitfalls that can derail promising careers or research programs.

Institutional hierarchies determine who has authority to make decisions, approve funding, and set policy directions within large organizations. Characters must understand these structures to direct their requests and proposals toward appropriate decision-makers while respecting chains of command that might seem illogical from outside perspectives.

Competing interests within institutions create complex political dynamics as different departments, research groups, or administrative divisions compete for limited resources and organizational support. Characters often find themselves navigating these internal politics while pursuing their primary objectives, requiring diplomatic skills and strategic thinking.

Alliance building helps characters develop support networks within institutions that can provide assistance, information, and advocacy for their projects and career advancement. Successful alliance building requires understanding what different people value and finding ways to provide mutual benefit through cooperation.

Information networks determine access to institutional knowledge, advance warning about policy changes, and insights into informal power structures that might not be apparent from organizational charts. Characters who develop good information sources find themselves better positioned to anticipate challenges and opportunities.

Reputation management affects how institutions and their members perceive character capabilities, reliability, and value to organizational objectives. Positive reputations open doors and create opportunities, while negative reputations can close off access to resources and collaboration possibilities. Characters must balance short-term tactical advantage against long-term relationship consequences.

### **CRISIS COMMUNICATION AND EMERGENCY DIPLOMACY**

Emergency situations often require immediate diplomatic responses under high-stress conditions where normal negotiation procedures are too slow or inappropriate for urgent circumstances. Crisis communication skills help characters manage emergency situations while preserving relationships and avoiding escalation that could make bad situations worse.

Rapid assessment helps characters quickly identify the key factors affecting crisis situations: who has authority to make decisions, what information is available, what time constraints exist, and what resources might be applicable to crisis resolution. Success often depends on making good decisions with incomplete information under significant time pressure.

Stakeholder identification determines who must be involved in crisis resolution and what their primary concerns are likely to be. Crisis situations often involve multiple parties with competing interests and varying authority levels. Characters must quickly understand these relationships to communicate effectively with appropriate people.

Message clarity becomes crucial when time pressure and stress make complex communication difficult. Characters must convey essential information clearly while avoiding misunderstandings that could exacerbate crisis conditions. This often requires balancing completeness against brevity in ways that ensure critical information reaches decision-makers.

Escalation management seeks to prevent crisis situations from expanding beyond their original scope through poor communication, misunderstanding, or emotional responses that cloud judgment. Characters often serve as intermediaries between parties who might otherwise react badly to direct contact during high-stress periods.

Relationship preservation attempts to maintain cooperative relationships despite crisis pressures that might otherwise damage long-term cooperation possibilities. Characters must balance immediate crisis resolution needs against the importance of maintaining trust and goodwill for future interactions.

## **CHAPTER 7: ADVANCED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY**

*Tools and devices for sophisticated adventures*

The atomic age provides explorers with equipment that would have seemed like pure magic to earlier generations: computers that think, rockets that travel between worlds as easily as crossing cities, weapons that fire pure energy, and communication systems that span the solar system. Understanding these technologies and their capabilities helps characters use them effectively while appreciating their limitations and potential consequences.

### **CHEMICAL X TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS**

Chemical X represents the breakthrough that made the atomic age possible, providing energy densities and reaction characteristics that enable everything from interplanetary travel to portable ray guns. While the exact principles remain proprietary to Utonium Industries, understanding Chemical X applications helps characters make informed decisions about equipment selection and usage.

Chemical X rockets achieve constant acceleration profiles that make interplanetary travel practical for civilian use. Unlike conventional rockets that expend fuel mass continuously, Chemical X systems maintain consistent thrust-to-weight ratios throughout their operational periods. This enables the brachistochrone trajectories that reduce travel times from months to days while providing comfortable artificial gravity for passengers.

Fuel efficiency surpasses anything previously achieved in human technology. Chemical X systems operate at energy densities that approach theoretical limits while maintaining safety margins appropriate for civilian applications. This efficiency makes personal spacecraft practical and economical for individuals and small groups rather than requiring massive institutional resources.

Inertial compensation protects passengers from the physiological effects of sustained acceleration that would otherwise make Chemical X travel impractical. The technology somehow reduces the apparent effects of acceleration on biological systems without violating conservation of momentum, suggesting exotic physics principles that researchers don't yet fully understand.

Safety systems built into Chemical X technology prevent catastrophic failures that could result from such concentrated energy sources. Multiple redundant systems monitor fuel containment, reaction rates, and system integrity while providing automatic shutdown capabilities if dangerous conditions develop. These safety measures make Chemical X technology reliable enough for civilian use despite its tremendous power potential.

Environmental compatibility ensures that Chemical X systems operate safely across the diverse conditions found throughout the solar system. The technology functions reliably in the hard vacuum of space, the crushing atmosphere of Venus, the thin air of Mars, and the radiation environment near Jupiter. This versatility makes Chemical X the universal power source for atomic age technology.

### **COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**

Atomic age computing combines the reliability of vacuum tube electronics with the sophistication of positronic processing systems to create computational capabilities that rival human intelligence in specific domains while maintaining the safety characteristics essential for critical applications.

Positronic computers use artificial neural networks based on positron flow patterns that mimic biological intelligence while maintaining digital precision and reliability. These systems can learn from experience, recognize complex patterns, and make decisions based on incomplete information in ways that traditional computing cannot achieve.

Three Laws compliance ensures that positronic systems remain safe for human interaction despite their sophisticated decision-making capabilities. The famous robotic laws built into positronic architecture prevent these systems from harming humans through action or inaction while maintaining their effectiveness for productive tasks.

Processing capabilities exceed human performance in specific domains such as mathematical calculation, data analysis, and pattern recognition while remaining inferior to human intelligence in areas requiring creativity, intuition, and emotional understanding. This creates natural partnerships between human operators and positronic systems.

Memory systems provide perfect recall and rapid access to vast information databases while maintaining data integrity over extended periods. Positronic memory doesn't suffer from the degradation or distortion that affects biological memory, making these systems excellent for information storage and retrieval applications.

Interface design allows natural interaction between human operators and positronic systems through voice commands, visual displays, and direct neural interface for specially trained operators. These interfaces make positronic computing accessible to users without extensive technical training while providing sophisticated capabilities for expert operators.

#### **The Robotic Repair Circuit System**

When sophisticated positronic systems suffer major damage or unknown malfunctions—personality instabilities, positronic brain failures, or damage from exotic sources—use the Circuit Card System. This represents the complex process of diagnosing and repairing systems that combine mechanical engineering with artificial consciousness.

**When to Use the Circuit System**

Not every repair needs the full circuit treatment:

**Simple Repairs** (Standard Roll): Routine maintenance, replacing damaged components, quick fixes during action scenes, emergency "get it working" solutions.

**Complex Repairs** (Circuit System): Positronic brain malfunctions, personality core instabilities, unknown damage from exotic sources, major system integration problems, upgrading or modifying robot capabilities.

**Circuit Repair Approaches**

Like research, robotics repair uses four distinct methodologies representing different problem-solving philosophies:

- **♥️ HEARTS: Intuitive/Personal Approach** - Working with the robot's personality and understanding its quirks using Animal Handling (Robot Psychology), Social skills
- **♦️ DIAMONDS: Technical/Engineering Approach** - Following proper procedures and technical manuals using Engineering (Robotics), Technology skills  
- **♣️ CLUBS: Mechanical/Physical Approach** - Hands-on component replacement and physical fixes using Repair skills, Athletics for physical work
- **♠️ SPADES: Theoretical/Programming Approach** - Working with the robot's logical systems and programming using Computer Systems, Science (Logic) skills

**Circuit Point Accumulation**

Characters accumulate Circuit Points through skill checks using their chosen approach:
- **Critical Success**: 3 Circuit Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Circuit Points
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Circuit Point

**EXTRA SUCCESS OPTIONS**: When you get Special or Critical Success, excess Circuit Points can be spent as:
- **Standard**: Extra points toward clearing current node
- **CIRCUIT ANALYSIS**: Reveal next same-approach card (1 point per peek)
- **PROBLEM PREVENTION**: Discard a revealed card - draw replacement (1 point per discard)
- **CIRCUIT STORAGE**: Store up to 5 Circuit Points for current approach (1:1)

**Enhanced Navigation Rules**

**Primary Approach Cards** (same suit): Must accumulate Circuit Points equal to card value.

**Secondary Approach Cards** (different suits) create outcomes based on value comparison:

**HIGHER VALUE** = *Cross-System Synergy*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Robot cooperation - gain +1 Circuit Point toward current node
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Technical insight - reduce current node requirement by 1
- **♣️ Clubs**: Physical advantage - next skill roll gets +20% bonus
- **♠️ Spades**: Logic shortcut - reveal next card without drawing it

**EXACT MATCH** = *Perfect Integration*
- Any suit: Immediately gain +2 Circuit Points AND reduce node requirement by 1

**LOWER VALUE** = *Cross-System Interference*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Robot confusion - make Psychology check or lose 1 Circuit Point
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Technical conflict - choose: spend 1 Spare Part or -20% to next roll
- **♣️ Clubs**: Physical obstruction - must clear before continuing (costs 1 Circuit Point)
- **♠️ Spades**: Logic conflict - current approach locked until node complete

**Failure-Driven Complications**

- **Special Failure**: Draw random card - this becomes a sidetrack in that suit (keep progress and foresight)
- **Critical Failure**: Draw random card - sidetrack + lose any stored Circuit Analysis benefits
- **Completing Sidetrack**: Choose to continue in sidetrack suit OR return to previous working suit
- **Path Memory**: You can only choose between your two most recently used approaches

**Repair Failure Conditions**

Repair permanently fails when ANY of the following occurs:

**ATTEMPT EXHAUSTION**
- After **12 failed skill rolls** on a single node
- **Narrative**: "You've exhausted every technique you know - this approach isn't working"
- **Game Effect**: Current node becomes "burned out" - cannot be approached via this suit again
- **Options**: Must switch to different approach or abandon repair

**RESOURCE DEPLETION**
- When Spare Parts are exhausted (**15 total limit** per repair sequence)  
- **Narrative**: "You've used all available components and materials"
- **Game Effect**: Cannot reduce node requirements or handle technical complications
- **Options**: Continue with skill rolls only, or stop repair

**SYSTEM DEGRADATION**
- When the next same-suit card is **≥4 values higher** than current node
- **Narrative**: "Your modifications are destabilizing the core systems - continuing risks permanent damage"
- **Game Effect**: Immediate repair failure; no further cards can be addressed in this sequence
- **Prevention**: Use CIRCUIT ANALYSIS to spot dangerous sequences, PROBLEM PREVENTION to discard them

**CASCADE FAILURE**
- Drawing **3 consecutive Jacks** triggers system-wide instability
- **Narrative**: "Multiple system conflicts have created an unrecoverable cascade failure"
- **Game Effect**: Robot suffers permanent damage, requires factory reset or major overhaul
- **Prevention**: Use PROBLEM PREVENTION to discard Jack complications when possible

**Resource Management**

**Spare Parts**: Common Components (reduce Circuit Points by 1), Specialized Parts (reduce by 2), Rare Components (reduce by 3), Resource Limit: Maximum **15 total parts** per repair sequence

**Time Pressure**: Workshop Conditions (no penalties), Field Conditions (-20% to all repair rolls), Combat Conditions (-40% to all repair rolls, can only work in safe rounds)

**Assistant Help**: Knowledgeable Assistant (can contribute maximum 1 Circuit Point per roll), Untrained Assistant (+10% to primary technician's rolls)

### **WEAPONS AND DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS**

Atomic age weaponry emphasizes precision and non-lethality while providing effective protection against the various threats encountered during interplanetary exploration. Modern weapons are designed to disable rather than destroy while offering options appropriate for different tactical situations.

Ray guns represent the pinnacle of personal weapon technology, firing precisely controlled energy beams that can be adjusted for various effects from mild stunning to structural cutting. The versatility of ray gun technology makes these weapons suitable for both combat and utility applications while eliminating ammunition supply concerns.

Stun settings provide non-lethal alternatives for situations requiring subdual rather than elimination of opponents. These settings can incapacitate targets temporarily while avoiding permanent injury, making ray guns appropriate for law enforcement and personal defense applications where lethal force isn't warranted.

Cutting modes enable ray guns to function as precision tools for emergency situations, equipment maintenance, and obstacle removal. The ability to adjust beam characteristics for different materials makes ray guns valuable utility devices beyond their obvious combat applications.

Defensive shields create energy barriers that deflect or absorb incoming attacks while maintaining user mobility. Personal shield systems protect against both energy weapons and projectile attacks while allowing the user to move freely and return fire. Shield technology operates on power consumption principles that balance protection level against operational duration.

Armor systems provide physical protection against environmental hazards and weapon effects that might overwhelm personal shields. Modern armor combines lightweight materials with environmental control systems to maintain user comfort and mobility while providing protection against vacuum exposure, radiation, and physical impacts.

### **MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY**

Atomic age medicine combines traditional biological knowledge with atomic era innovations to provide medical capabilities that approach science fiction levels while remaining grounded in extended understanding of biological processes and healing mechanisms.

Diagnostic systems can rapidly identify medical conditions through non-invasive scanning techniques that provide detailed information about biological function and dysfunction. These systems combine electromagnetic analysis with biological sensors to create complete medical profiles without requiring traditional invasive testing procedures.

Treatment applications range from minor injury repair to major surgical procedures that can be completed in hours rather than days or weeks. Atomic age medical technology accelerates natural healing processes while providing precision intervention capabilities that minimize patient trauma and recovery time.

Regeneration techniques enable repair of injuries that would be permanently disabling using conventional medicine. While true regeneration remains experimental, current techniques can restore function to damaged organs and tissues through guided healing processes that direct biological repair mechanisms.

Life support systems maintain patient viability during extended medical procedures or while traveling to appropriate treatment facilities. Portable life support can sustain patients for days or weeks while they receive definitive medical care, making emergency medical response practical across the vast distances of the atomic age.

Preventive medicine includes radiation protection, disease immunity, and adaptation assistance for individuals working in exotic environments throughout the solar system. These preventive measures make long-term space travel and alien world exploration medically practical for personnel without extensive medical training.

#### **The Medical Card System**

For serious injuries requiring sustained medical attention—battlefield trauma, exotic poisoning, radiation exposure, or alien pathogen infection—use the Medical Card System. This framework represents the complexity of treating severe injuries under frontier conditions where medical resources are limited and evacuation to proper facilities isn't possible.

**Suit Specializations**

Medical treatment is diagnosis-locked to specific injury types based on the cause of damage. The GM will start by fanning through the deck to fnid the first card of the correct suit for the type of medical problem, cutting the deck there and turning over that top card.  Treatment follows from there:

- **♥️ HEARTS**: Bleeding & Circulation (Internal medicine, blood loss, shock)
- **♣️ CLUBS**: Trauma & Impact (Fractures, lacerations, penetrating wounds)  
- **♠️ SPADES**: Toxins & Disease (Poisons, infections, pathogens, radiation sickness)
- **♦️ DIAMONDS**: Burns & Energy (Heat damage, radiation burns, energy weapon wounds)

**Treatment Sequence**

Draw cards one at a time. Compare each card's value to the current card being treated:

**Primary Suit Cards** (based on injury type):
- Must accumulate Treatment Points equal to card value to clear
- Each cleared primary card converts 1 Wound to 1 Strain
- **ESCALATION CHECK**: Before treating each new primary suit card, check if it's ≥3 values higher than the previous primary card. If so, treatment escalation occurs (see Failure Conditions below).

**Secondary Cards** (other suits) create outcomes based on value comparison:

**HIGHER VALUE** = *Positive Response*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Patient stabilizes - recover 1 strain immediately  
- **♣️ Clubs**: Treatment going smoothly - gain +1 Treatment Point toward current card
- **♠️ Spades**: No infection - immune to infection complications for rest of treatment
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Equipment working perfectly - next Medicine check at +20%

**EXACT MATCH** = *Perfect Response*
- Any suit: Immediately clear 1 strain (if any) AND gain +2 Treatment Points

**LOWER VALUE** = *Complications*
- **♥️ Hearts**: Patient instability - Make GRIT check or go into shock
- **♣️ Clubs**: Physical setback - Choose: spend 1 MSU or gain 1 strain  
- **♠️ Spades**: Infection risk - Make Medicine check or draw 1 Spades card later
- **♦️ Diamonds**: Equipment malfunction - Spend 1 Energy Unit or -20% to Medicine checks

**Skill-Based Treatment**

Progress through cards using Treatment Points accumulated from Medicine checks:
- **Critical Success**: 3 Treatment Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Treatment Points  
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Treatment Point

**EXTRA SUCCESS OPTIONS**: When you get Special or Critical Success, excess Treatment Points can be spent as:
- **Standard**: Extra points toward clearing current card
- **FORESIGHT**: Reveal next card without drawing it (1 point per peek)
- **PREVENTION**: Discard a future card before it happens (1 point per discard)

**Medical Resource Options**

**SPEND MEDICAL SUPPLIES (MSU)**
- Cost: 1 MSU per Treatment Point gained
- Effect: Automatic progress without rolling
- Limitation: Maximum 3 MSU per card, **20 MSU total per treatment sequence**

**SPEND TIME (Extended Care)**
- Cost: 2 hours per auto-clear
- Effect: Automatically clear any card of value 4 or less
- Limitation: Patient must be stable (not critical condition)

**EMERGENCY INTERVENTION**
- Cost: 2 MSU + Medicine check at -20%
- Effect: Immediately clear current card regardless of value
- Risk: Special/Critical failure causes secondary complications

**Treatment Failure Conditions**

Treatment permanently fails when ANY of the following occurs:

**ATTEMPT EXHAUSTION**
- After **15 failed Medicine rolls** on a single card
- **Narrative**: "You've tried everything you know, but the injury is beyond your current skill"
- **Game Effect**: Current card remains untreated; wound stays as wound (not converted to strain)
- **Options**: Stop treatment here, or continue to next card if sequence allows

**RESOURCE DEPLETION**
- When MSU supplies are exhausted (**20 total limit** per treatment sequence)
- **Narrative**: "You've used all available medical supplies"
- **Game Effect**: Cannot spend MSU for automatic treatment points or complications
- **Options**: Continue with skill rolls only, or stop treatment

**TREATMENT ESCALATION**
- When the next primary suit card in sequence is **≥3 values higher** than current card
- Check occurs **before** starting treatment on each new primary card
- **Narrative**: "Your intervention is making the condition worse - continuing risks serious complications"
- **Game Effect**: Immediate treatment failure; no further cards can be treated in this sequence
- **Prevention**: Use FORESIGHT or PREVENTION extra success options to discard dangerous upcoming cards

**Face Card Complications**

**Jacks (Treatment Complications)**
- **♥️ Heart Jack - Hemorrhage**: Patient losing blood; GRIT check or suffer additional wound
- **♣️ Club Jack - Compound Fracture**: Bone fragments causing tissue damage
- **♠️ Spade Jack - Toxic Reaction**: Allergic response to treatment; switch to alternative approach
- **♦️ Diamond Jack - Tissue Necrosis**: Damaged tissue spreading; immediate surgical intervention required

**Queens (Critical Decisions)**
- **♥️ Heart Queen - Cardiac Arrest**: Emergency resuscitation; success saves patient, failure = death
- **♣️ Club Queen - Emergency Surgery**: Must choose between saving limb or saving life
- **♠️ Spade Queen - Organ Failure**: Requires rare antidote or cybernetic replacement
- **♦️ Diamond Queen - Radiation Cascade**: Cellular damage spreading; experimental treatment required

- **♦️ Diamond King - Cybernetic Integration**: Damage too severe; requires artificial replacement

### **COMMUNICATION AND SENSOR TECHNOLOGY**

Information gathering and transmission capabilities determine mission success for exploration and diplomatic activities throughout the solar system. Modern sensor and communication systems provide unprecedented capabilities while operating reliably under the harsh conditions found beyond Earth.

Long-range communication systems enable contact across planetary distances while managing the light-speed delays that affect all electromagnetic communication. Advanced transmission techniques maximize information transfer rates while minimizing power consumption for extended operations far from resupply sources.

Sensor arrays can detect and analyze phenomena across electromagnetic and exotic energy spectrums to provide detailed information about objects, energy patterns, and biological activities at considerable distances. These sensors often provide the first warning of dangerous conditions or interesting discoveries.

Recording systems preserve sensor data and communication intercepts for later analysis while maintaining data integrity during extended missions. The ability to record everything provides opportunities for discovering information that wasn't apparent during initial observation or communication.

Analysis software helps operators interpret complex sensor data and communication patterns to extract meaningful information from enormous data volumes. These systems can identify patterns, anomalies, and correlations that human operators might miss while processing information rapidly enough for tactical decision-making.

Network integration allows individual sensor and communication systems to share information and coordinate operations automatically. Networked systems provide redundancy against equipment failure while enhancing overall capability through information fusion and coordinated operation.

## **CHAPTER 7: SOCIAL CONTESTS**

*The art of persuasion in the atomic tomorrow*

In the retro-future world of Atomic Tomorrow, fast talking, seduction, and persuasion are skills as valuable as marksmanship or piloting. This system provides guidelines for handling social interactions as meaningful contests without undermining player agency or reducing complex interpersonal dynamics to simple dice rolls.

### **PRINCIPLES**

1. **Social Skills Are Not Mind Control**: Even critical successes cannot force others to act against their core values or self-interest
2. **Preserve Agency**: Player characters always retain the right to determine their own actions
3. **Reward Roleplay**: Going along with social influence (even when disadvantageous) enriches the story
4. **Consequences Matter**: Social skills create believable reactions based on the context and relationship

### **TYPES OF SOCIAL CONTESTS**

#### **Persuasion**
*Convincing someone that a course of action is logical, moral, or beneficial*

- Uses CHARM vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes you are sincere and your argument has merit
- Doesn't override strong ethical objections or survival instincts

#### **Deception**
*Convincing someone to believe something that isn't true*

- Uses GUILE vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes your falsehood
- Extreme claims still receive appropriate skepticism even on success

#### **Intimidation**
*Frightening someone into compliance*

- Uses BRAWN (physical) or NERVE (psychological) vs. GRIT
- Success means the target feels genuinely threatened
- Temporary compliance only; may create resentment and future retaliation

#### **Seduction**
*Appealing to someone's attraction or desire*

- Uses CHARM vs. CHARM
- Success means the target finds you genuinely appealing
- Doesn't override professional ethics, loyalty, or self-preservation

### **THE CONVICTION TRACK**

| Level | State     | Description                 |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 1     | Convinced | Fully accepts the position  |
| 2     | Receptive | Inclined to agree           |
| 3     | Neutral   | Undecided, weighing options |
| 4     | Skeptical | Doubtful but listening      |
| 5     | Opposed   | Firmly against the position |

#### **Starting Position**

NPCs begin at different positions based on their initial attitude and the request's nature:

- **Friendly/Reasonable Request**: Start at 2 (Receptive)
- **Neutral/Moderate Request**: Start at 3 (Neutral)
- **Unfriendly/Unreasonable Request**: Start at 4 (Skeptical)
- **Hostile/Outrageous Request**: Start at 5 (Opposed)

#### **Symmetrical Success/Failure Effects**

When attempting social influence:

1. Make an opposed roll using the appropriate social skill against their resistance
2. Movement on the Conviction Track is symmetrical:
   - **Critical Success**: Move 3 steps toward Convinced
   - **Special Success**: Move 2 steps toward Convinced
   - **Regular Success**: Move 1 step toward Convinced
   - **Regular Failure**: Move 1 step toward Opposed
   - **Special Failure**: Move 2 steps toward Opposed
   - **Critical Failure**: Move 3 steps toward Opposed

### **PLAYER CHARACTER TARGETS**

When NPCs attempt to influence player characters:

1. The GM rolls the NPC's social skill against the player's resistance attribute
2. The GM reports the success quality and current position on the Conviction Track
3. The player decides how their character responds, guided by the Conviction Track
4. **Experience Reward**: When a player goes along with social influence that leads to suboptimal choices based on the Conviction Track, they automatically receive a skill advancement check for that adventure

This creates a rewarding gameplay loop where players gain mechanical benefits when they embrace roleplaying over pure tactical advantage.

### **INTERACTION LIMITS**

To prevent endless attempts:

- Each social interaction scene allows a maximum of 3 influence attempts
- After the third attempt, the target's position becomes fixed until circumstances significantly change
- Each subsequent attempt within a scene incurs a cumulative -20% penalty

### **ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**

Social contests are heavily influenced by context:

#### **Favorable Circumstances (+20%)**

- Using leverage the target cares about
- Offering something the target genuinely needs
- Having reputation or credentials relevant to the request
- Previous positive relationship with the target

#### **Unfavorable Circumstances (-20%)**

- Target has prior negative experience with you
- Request clearly conflicts with target's interests
- Significant status difference (when attempting to influence superiors)
- Target is suspicious or on guard

### **LONG-TERM INFLUENCE**

Social contests aren't just for immediate results. Successful social interactions can:

1. **Build Reputation**: Making honest persuasion attempts builds credibility for future interactions
2. **Create Relationships**: Successful social contests can begin long-term connections with NPCs
3. **Establish Patterns**: Regularly deceiving someone eventually leads to suspicion
4. **Yield Information**: Even failed attempts can reveal what someone values or fears

### **SOCIAL CONTESTS BETWEEN PLAYERS**

When one player character attempts to influence another:

1. The initiating player rolls their relevant social skill
2. The target player rolls their relevant resistance attribute
3. The GM describes the quality of the attempt
4. **The target player decides their own response**
5. If they choose to go along with something disadvantageous to them, they receive the experience reward

### **EXPERIENCE REWARD**

*"Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment."*

When a player goes along with a successful social attempt that leads their character to make suboptimal choices:

- The character automatically receives a skill advancement check for that adventure
- This represents learning from mistakes and developing better judgment
- The advancement works according to the standard skill advancement rules

This reward applies when:

- The character takes actions they wouldn't normally take
- These actions create additional complications or challenges
- The player embraces these complications for storytelling purposes

### **DIPLOMATIC PROTOCOL AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**

The atomic age brings together cultures that have developed under wildly different conditions: Earth societies with their ancient traditions, colonial communities adapted to alien environments, and potentially non-human intelligences with completely different social assumptions. Successful diplomacy requires understanding and respecting these differences while finding common ground for cooperation.

Cultural research becomes essential preparation for diplomatic missions as social norms vary dramatically between different human communities and even more between species. What constitutes polite behavior on Earth might be deeply offensive to Martian colonial societies. Gestures, vocal tones, and personal space expectations all carry cultural significance that diplomats must understand to avoid inadvertent insults.

Protocol awareness helps diplomats navigate the formal structures that govern inter-group relationships. Different societies have developed various approaches to status recognition, authority structures, and decision-making processes. Understanding these protocols allows diplomats to work within established systems rather than accidentally violating procedural expectations.

Translation challenges go beyond simple language differences to include conceptual frameworks that might not exist across cultural boundaries. Some ideas that are fundamental to one society might have no equivalent in another's thinking. Skilled diplomats learn to find metaphors and explanations that bridge these conceptual gaps without losing essential meaning.

### **SOCIAL CONTEST PLAY EXAMPLE**

**Scenario**: Dr. Elena Vasquez needs to convince Commander Harrison to allow her research team access to the restricted section of the Luna City Archives, where classified pre-war scientific documents are stored.

**Setup**: Commander Harrison is protective of his facility's security (starting at 4 - Skeptical) but respects Dr. Vasquez's scientific credentials (+20% favorable circumstances for her reputation).

**Round 1 - Initial Persuasion**
**Dr. Vasquez (Scientist)**: "Commander, I understand your security concerns, but these archives may contain critical information about the Mysterion artifacts we recovered. The war-era scientists might have encountered similar technology."

*Elena rolls Persuasion (CHARM 65% +20% = 85%) vs. Commander Harrison's GUILE 50%*
*Elena rolls 23 - Special Success (ends in 5, under skill)*
*Harrison rolls 67 - Failure*

**GM**: "Elena's argument clearly resonates with the Commander. He leans forward, intrigued despite his initial caution."

*Conviction Track: 4 (Skeptical) → 2 (Receptive) - moves 2 steps toward Convinced*

**Round 2 - Building on Success**
**Dr. Vasquez**: "I'm not asking for unrestricted access. Perhaps you could assign one of your security officers to escort my team? That way we maintain protocol while advancing critical research."

*Elena rolls Persuasion (85%) vs. Harrison's GUILE 50%*
*Elena rolls 31 - Ordinary Success*
*Harrison rolls 72 - Failure*

**GM**: "Harrison nods slowly. Your reasonable approach to security concerns is clearly winning him over."

*Conviction Track: 2 (Receptive) → 1 (Convinced) - moves 1 step toward Convinced*

**Commander Harrison**: "Dr. Vasquez, I think we can arrange something. Sergeant Rodriguez will escort your team and ensure proper handling of the classified materials. When can you start?"

**Result**: Elena successfully negotiated access to the restricted archives by understanding Harrison's security concerns and proposing a solution that addressed both parties' needs. Her reputation and reasonable approach made the difference between suspicion and cooperation.

## **CHAPTER 8: INTERPLANETARY COMMERCE SYSTEM**

*Making your fortune among the stars*

The dusty spaceport bars of Mars and the gleaming commerce centers of Earth all echo with the same tales: daring traders who struck it rich hauling exotic tech from Venus to the Belt, or desperate captains who lost everything on a hold full of Venusian silk that nobody would buy. In the atomic age, interplanetary commerce offers both opportunity and risk for those bold enough to stake their claim among the stars.

The Atomic Tomorrow trading system simulates the challenge of finding profitable cargo routes across the Solar System. Players use their Trading skill to acquire goods at one location and sell them at another, navigating the economic complexities of different worlds.

   - Trading skill 65%, rolls 43 (success, +1 bonus)
   - Rolls 7, 3 for Trading; with +1 bonus and +2 Production bonus = 10, 3
   - Rolls 5+2, 3+2 for cargo = 7, 5
   - Successfully acquires cargo for 500 credits (lowest cargo die × 100)

2. She flies to Mars (Consumption area) to sell
   - Trading skill 65%, rolls 25 (special success, +2 bonus)
   - Rolls 4+2, 1+2 for cargo; with +2 bonus and +2 Consumption bonus = 8, 3
   - Rolls 7+6, 4+6 for location wealth = 13, 10
   - Fails to find a buyer (8 < 13)

3. She tries again a few days later
   - Trading skill 65%, rolls 65 (success, +1 bonus)
   - Rolls 8+2, 2+2 for cargo; with +1 bonus and +2 Consumption bonus = 11, 4
   - Rolls 5+6, 3+6 for location wealth = 11, 9
   - Gets a buyer (11 ≥ 11, ties favor trader)
   - Selling price = 900 credits (lowest wealth die × 100)
   - Profit = 400 credits

*"Buy low, sell high, and know when to jettison the cargo before the Patrol comes knocking. That's the Trader's Creed, kid." - Captain Liza "Lucky" Goldstein, veteran Belt trader*

## **CHAPTER 9: ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION**

*Maintaining your mechanical companions*

The atomic age relies heavily on robotic assistance for dangerous, repetitive, or precision tasks that would be impractical for human workers. However, these sophisticated machines require regular maintenance and occasional repair to continue functioning reliably. The robotics repair system provides detailed mechanics for diagnosing problems and restoring robotic systems to full operation.

### **ROBOTIC SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS**

#### **Core Components**

All robotic systems share certain fundamental components that enable autonomous operation:

**Positronic Brain**: The central processing unit that enables artificial intelligence and decision-making capabilities. Positronic brains follow Asimov's Three Laws and provide the cognitive functions that distinguish robots from simple automation.

**Motor Systems**: Physical actuators that enable movement and manipulation. These range from simple linear actuators to complex servo systems that provide precise control over robotic limbs and tools.

**Sensor Arrays**: Input devices that gather information about the robot's environment and operational status. Advanced robots integrate multiple sensor types to create comprehensive environmental awareness.

**Power Distribution**: Energy management systems that efficiently distribute power to all robotic subsystems while maintaining operational safety and preventing electrical failures.

#### **Failure Categories**

Robotic failures typically fall into predictable categories that require different diagnostic and repair approaches:

**Logic Errors**: Problems with decision-making processes or response priorities that cause inappropriate behavior without affecting physical capabilities.

**Mechanical Failures**: Physical component breakdown that affects movement, manipulation, or structural integrity but leaves cognitive functions intact.

**Sensor Malfunction**: Input system problems that provide incorrect or incomplete environmental information, leading to poor decision-making despite functioning logic systems.

**Power System Issues**: Energy distribution problems that affect overall performance or create cascading failures across multiple subsystems.

### **DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES**

#### **Initial Assessment**

Robot repair begins with systematic evaluation to identify the nature and scope of problems:

**Behavioral Observation**: Watch the robot's actions and responses to identify obvious malfunctions or inappropriate behaviors that suggest specific system failures.

**Status Indicator Review**: Check all warning lights, display panels, and audio alerts that might provide direct information about detected problems.

**Basic Function Testing**: Verify operation of fundamental systems through simple commands and observe whether responses match expected behavior patterns.

#### **System-Specific Diagnostics**

**Positronic Brain Testing**: Evaluate logical processes through standardized question sequences and observe response patterns for signs of cognitive malfunction.

**Motor Function Evaluation**: Test movement and manipulation capabilities through calibrated exercises that reveal mechanical limitations or control problems.

**Sensor Calibration Checks**: Compare sensor readings against known standards to identify accuracy problems or complete sensor failures.

**Power System Analysis**: Measure voltage levels, current flows, and energy distribution patterns to locate electrical problems affecting robot performance.

### **REPAIR PROCEDURES**

#### **Circuit Card Replacement System**

Complex robotic systems use modular circuit cards that can be replaced when individual subsystems fail. This system provides detailed mechanics for diagnosing which cards need replacement and successfully installing new components.

**Card Identification**: Each circuit card controls specific robot functions and must be correctly identified before replacement. Misidentifying cards can worsen problems or create new malfunctions.

**Removal Procedures**: Cards must be carefully extracted without damaging surrounding components or disrupting other systems that remain operational.

**Installation Verification**: New cards require proper installation and verification testing to ensure correct function integration with existing robot systems.

#### **Component Repair vs. Replacement**

**Minor Repairs**: Simple problems like loose connections, worn contacts, or calibration drift can often be corrected through adjustment or cleaning without component replacement.

**Major Overhauls**: Extensive damage or wear might require complete subsystem replacement or reconstruction using multiple new components.

**Upgrade Opportunities**: Repair situations sometimes provide chances to install improved components that enhance robot capabilities beyond original specifications.

### **SPECIALIZED ROBOT TYPES**

#### **Industrial Robots**

Heavy-duty machines designed for manufacturing, construction, and resource extraction in challenging environments.

**Typical Problems**: Mechanical wear from heavy use, environmental contamination, overload damage from excessive work demands.

**Repair Considerations**: Often require heavy-duty components and specialized tools for maintenance in industrial settings.

#### **Domestic Robots**

Household assistance robots designed for cleaning, cooking, and personal service in civilian environments.

**Typical Problems**: Software conflicts from complex scheduling, minor mechanical wear, sensor contamination from household substances.

**Repair Considerations**: Emphasize user safety and appearance restoration along with functional repair.

#### **Military Robots**

Combat and security robots designed for dangerous operations in hostile environments.

**Typical Problems**: Battle damage, security system malfunctions, armor integration issues affecting mobility.

**Repair Considerations**: Often require security clearances and specialized military components for proper restoration.

## **CHAPTER 10: CHASE SYSTEMS**

*High-speed pursuits through the atomic tomorrow*

In the atomic age, high-speed chases aren't just about raw speed—they're about split-second decisions, daring maneuvers, and the kind of atomic-powered technology that can turn a routine pursuit into a spectacular adventure. Whether you're racing through the pressure tunnels of Luna, diving through Venus's cloud canyons, or weaving between asteroids in the Belt, the chase system captures the white-knuckle excitement of atomic age pursuit.

### **CORE MECHANICS: TWO-PHASE PURSUIT**

Each round, track the current distance between vehicles using a die or marker. When distance reaches or exceeds the escape threshold, the lead vehicle successfully escapes. When distance drops to the contact threshold or below, the pursuer has caught up to the lead vehicle.

#### **Distance Tracking**

- **Distance 1-2**: Contact range (ramming, boarding possible)
- **Distance 3-4**: Close range (melee attacks possible with reach weapons)
- **Distance 5-7**: Medium range (most ranged weapons effective)
- **Distance 8-9**: Extended range (visual contact maintained)
- **Distance 10+**: Escape achieved (pursuer loses sight of the lead vehicle)

#### **Standard Chase Parameters**

**Default Chase** (Start: 5, Escape: 10):
- Creates tense, action-packed chases that typically resolve in 4-5 rounds
- Ideal for maintaining excitement without dominating your gaming session
- Balanced between pursuer and quarry advantages

**Extended Chases** (Start: 7, Escape: 12):
- Use for major story pursuits, complex urban environments, or when multiple hazards should be encountered
- Results in longer chases (6-8 rounds) with more opportunities for dramatic twists
- Better showcases vehicles with superior speed and Handling

**Quick Pursuits** (Start: 4, Escape: 8):
- Use for minor encounters, simple terrain, or when time is limited
- Creates brief, intense chases (2-3 rounds) that resolve quickly
- Favors the pursuer slightly, making escape more challenging

#### **Altitude Bands for Flying Vehicles**

When chases involve flying vehicles, consider these additional parameters:

- **Ground-Effect Band (0-20ft)**: Max Speed reduced by 2, but +1 Handling due to ground effect
- **Low Altitude Band (20-200ft)**: Normal Speed and Handling
- **High Altitude Band (200-1000ft)**: +1 Speed, -1 Handling due to wind patterns
- **Restricted Altitude (1000ft+)**: Requires special permits, military clearance

Flying vehicles have the advantage of vertical separation, allowing them to bypass ground traffic and obstacles. Changing to a higher band increases Distance by 1, while dropping to a lower band has no effect on Distance.

### **PHASE 1: DRIVING CONTEST**

Each round begins with an opposed Vehicle Operation roll between drivers:

#### **Opposed Roll Outcomes**

- **Lead vehicle wins by Critical vs. Failure**: +3 distance (pulls ahead)
- **Lead vehicle wins by Special vs. Regular/Failure**: +2 distance
- **Lead vehicle wins by Regular vs. Failure**: +1 distance
- **Pursuer wins by Critical vs. Failure**: -3 distance (closes gap)
- **Pursuer wins by Special vs. Regular/Failure**: -2 distance
- **Pursuer wins by Regular vs. Failure**: -1 distance
- **Same quality of success**: Higher roll wins, +/-1 distance

#### **Vehicle Factors**

- Add Speed (SP) and Handling (HA) modifiers to Vehicle Operation rolls
- Terrain Speed Caps limit effective SP advantage in certain environments

### **PHASE 2: HAZARD RESPONSE**

After determining distance change in Phase 1, the referee randomly generates a hazard:

#### **Hazard Generation**

- Referee rolls d10 to determine hazard type
- Lead driver selects Risk Level (1-3)
- Lead driver makes Vehicle Operation roll with modifiers for Risk Level and HA
- **Success**: No additional effect (already accounted for in Phase 1)
- **Failure**: Lead vehicle rolls on Mishap Table with modifier based on Risk Level

#### **Pursuer Options**

**FOLLOW THROUGH**
- Attempt the same hazard at same Risk Level
- **Success**: No additional distance change
- **Failure**: Distance increases by 3 (+1 for Special Failure, +2 for Critical Failure)
- **Critical Failure**: Distance increases by 5 and roll on Mishap Table with +20

**PLAY IT SAFE**
- Choose not to navigate the hazard
- Distance automatically increases by 4
- No roll on Mishap Table

**ALTERNATE ROUTE** (Only available for certain hazards)
- Attempt to find a different path
- Roll Navigation at -40%
- **Success**: Distance increases by 2
- **Special Success**: Distance increases by 1
- **Critical Success**: No distance change
- **Failure**: Distance increases by 5
- **Special Failure**: Distance increases by 7
- **Critical Failure**: Chase ends (completely lost visual contact)

### **SPECIAL ACTIONS**

These can be used instead of the normal Phase 2 options:

#### **Shortcut Gambit (Pursuer Only)**

- Desperate attempt to close distance by taking a risky detour
- Roll Navigation at -40%
- **Critical Success**: Distance decreases by 5
- **Special Success**: Distance decreases by 3
- **Regular Success**: Distance decreases by 2
- **Failure**: Distance increases by 3
- **Special Failure**: Distance increases by 5
- **Critical Failure**: Chase ends (completely lost)

#### **Chemical X Boost (One Use)**

- Push engines beyond safety limits, needs recharge after each use
- Roll Engineering (Propulsion) or Vehicle Operation
- **Success**: Lead gains +2 distance, pursuer loses -2 distance
- **Special Success**: Lead gains +3 distance, pursuer loses -3 distance
- **Critical Success**: Lead gains +4 distance, pursuer loses -4 distance
- **Failure**: No distance change and 1 damage to Propulsion
- **Critical Failure**: 2 damage to Propulsion and roll on Mishap Table

#### **Offensive Maneuver**

- Attempt to interfere with the other vehicle's progress
- Must be at distance 1-3
- Roll Vehicle Operation against opponent's Vehicle Operation
- **Success**: Opponent must make Vehicle Operation roll or take 1 damage to random system
- **Failure**: -1 distance advantage

#### **Gyroscopic Stabilization**
- **Normal Function**: +20% to any one hazard roll per chase
- **Description**: Advanced spinning gyros that maintain vehicle stability in extreme maneuvers
- **Catastrophe**: The precision gyros break free from their housings and tear through the vehicle's inner workings like metal pinballs. Vehicle spins wildly out of control, and all occupants must make REFLEX checks or be thrown about the cabin.

#### **Reinforced Frame**
- **Normal Function**: Ignore the first Structure damage in any chase
- **Description**: Advanced metallurgy and additional structural bracing with distinctive external braces
- **Catastrophe**: The reinforced components suddenly buckle under opposing stresses, twisting the vehicle's frame with a terrible metallic shriek. The vehicle's Structure system automatically takes the damage from this failure, and handling suffers -20% until repairs are completed.

#### **Atomic Cooling System**
- **Normal Function**: SP cannot be reduced by system damage
- **Description**: Specialized cooling apparatus with glowing blue conduits and distinctive fins
- **Catastrophe**: Pressurized cooling fluid erupts from ruptured pipes, instantly flash-freezing exposed components. Vehicle stalls completely and requires a successful Engineering (Propulsion) check to restart.

#### **Advanced Traction System**
- **Normal Function**: +20% to hazards involving surface changes or weather conditions
- **Description**: Automatically adjusting wheels/treads that conform to terrain conditions
- **Catastrophe**: The adaptive materials in the tires/treads suddenly shred themselves against the surface in a dramatic burst of rubber and sparks. Vehicle immediately loses 50% of its current speed and handling suffers -20% until repairs are completed.

#### **Atomic Radar**
- **Normal Function**: Once per chase, reveals outcome of Alternate Route before committing
- **Description**: Experimental scanning system with distinctive rotating dome antenna
- **Catastrophe**: The scanning system emits a high-pitched whine before the dome explodes in a shower of sparks and fragments. Driver suffers complete instrument failure, imposing -40% to all driving-related checks until a SAVVY check is passed.

## **CHAPTER 11: PSIONIC SYSTEMS**

*The hidden potential of the human mind in the atomic age*

In the atomic tomorrow, the same forces that split atoms and power rockets across space have awakened dormant capacities within the human mind itself. Psychic potential exists in all humans but usually remains locked away, emerging only through intensive training, genetic predisposition, or exposure to the exotic radiations that permeate the atomic age. The Rhine Institute was established to identify, train, and monitor those with active psionic capabilities—both for their safety and society's protection.

Understanding psionic abilities requires grasping a fundamental principle: the mind operates according to laws as rigorous as those governing atomic reactions, but infinitely more complex and personal. Every psychic discovers their own rhythm, their own limits, and their own relationship with forces that science can measure but not fully explain. These systems provide structure for that exploration while preserving the mystery that makes psionic abilities compelling rather than mundane.

### **THE PSI SKILL: UNIFIED PSYCHIC ABILITY**

Unlike other skills that represent training in specific techniques, Psi Skill reflects your character's overall attunement to psychic forces. All psionic disciplines—telepathy, telekinesis, precognition, empathy, and teleportation—use the same base skill percentage, modified by professional specialization and natural aptitude.

#### **Starting Psi Skill Values**

Your base Psi Skill equals (**NERVE × 2) + 40%** in your specialty discipline, **+0%** in other disciplines, and **-10%** in your opposed specialty. Add any bonuses from your Origin or Background to calculate your final percentages.

Psionic professions each have a specialty they excel at and a weakness where mental patterns conflict:

- **Mentalist**: Specialty Telepathy, Weakness Telekinesis
- **Telekinetic**: Specialty Telekinesis, Weakness Empathy  
- **Precog**: Specialty Precognition, Weakness Teleportation
- **Empath**: Specialty Empathy, Weakness Telekinesis
- **Teleporter**: Specialty Teleportation, Weakness Telepathy
- **Wild Talent**: All disciplines at -20%, but gains one unique power.  Specialists in other disciplines can't have wild talents.

This unified skill system reflects how all psionic abilities stem from the same fundamental mental capacity, while specialization represents focused development rather than completely separate training. A telepath attempting telekinesis uses the same core skill, but without the instinctive understanding that makes their specialty effortless.

### **POWER USAGE: FREE USES AND POWERED APPLICATIONS**

Psionic abilities operate on two distinct levels that reflect how psychic energy integrates with daily life. Understanding this distinction helps you portray psychic characters as naturally gifted individuals rather than walking superweapons who exhaust themselves lighting cigarettes.

#### **Free Uses (0 Successes Required)**

Simple applications that require no skill rolls and don't drain psychic reserves. These represent the unconscious psychic gestures that make experienced Espers seem slightly uncanny even during routine activities. Free Uses include:

**Telepathy**: Mental whispers to willing people within sight; sensing when someone thinks about you; sharing simple images or memories with willing participants.

**Telekinesis**: Floating lightweight objects like pencils or coffee cups; turning book pages while reading; gentle nudges to get someone's attention.

**Precognition**: Vague danger sense or good/bad "vibes"; intuitive feelings about which path to take; sensing whether someone means harm.

**Empathy**: Basic emotional reading of visible people; sensing a room's general mood; detecting obvious fear or anger.

**Teleportation**: Summoning small objects to your hand from across a room; making items appear in pockets instead of hands; teleporting dust off clothing.

Free Uses create the subtle background psychic activity that makes characters feel naturally gifted without requiring constant mechanical resolution. They're limited in scope but unlimited in frequency, representing capabilities so integrated into the psychic's life that they require no more conscious effort than walking or breathing.

#### **Powered Uses (1+ Successes Required)**

Dramatic applications requiring skill rolls and consuming psychic energy. These represent deliberate channeling of psionic forces for significant effects. The number of successes required reflects the complexity and power level of the intended effect:

**Light Uses (1 Success)**: Surface thoughts of unwilling targets; opening doors from across rooms; seeing 1-2 seconds ahead; detecting hidden emotions; short-distance teleportation to dodge attacks.

**Moderate Uses (2 Successes)**: Communication beyond visual range; lifting people briefly; previewing conversations before they happen; projecting calm to others; sending objects to people in other rooms.

**Heavy Uses (3+ Successes)**: Deep memory probes; devastating telekinetic attacks; detailed future visions; emotional manipulation of groups; long-range teleportation across significant distances.

The examples provided represent typical difficulty levels, but adapt freely based on circumstances. A telepathic contact with a willing, trusted friend might only require 1 success even across planetary distances, while reading the surface thoughts of a psychically trained opponent could demand 2 or more successes even at close range.

### **THE AURA SYSTEM: MANAGING PSYCHIC ENERGY**

Aura represents your current psychic energy reserves and your attunement to the subtle forces that make psionic abilities possible. Unlike Health or other renewable resources, Aura operates according to principles that reward careful use and punish reckless expenditure of psychic energy.

#### **Tracking Aura Levels**

- **Starting Aura**: Begin each day with Aura level 100, representing full psychic reserves
- **After Successful Power Use**: If your final successful roll equals or falls under your current Aura, your Aura becomes that roll value
- **Backlash Risk**: If your final successful roll exceeds your current Aura, suffer backlash and Aura remains unchanged

This system creates natural tension between using powerful abilities and maintaining psychic reserves. Early in the day, when Aura stands at 100, even difficult powers pose little backlash risk. As psychic energy diminishes through use, each additional power becomes increasingly dangerous, forcing characters to choose between pressing their limits and preserving their capabilities.

#### **Understanding Aura Dynamics**

Aura reduction isn't fatigue in the conventional sense—it represents growing misalignment between your consciousness and the psychic forces you're channeling. High Aura means you're perfectly attuned; low Aura means you're forcing connections that don't want to form naturally. This creates the backlash risk that makes continued power use increasingly dangerous.

The system naturally encourages varied approaches to challenges. Early in an adventure, characters might solve problems with flashy displays of psychic power. Later, as Aura dwindles, they'll need to rely more on conventional skills, teamwork, and creative thinking—exactly the kind of pacing that creates interesting character moments and prevents psionic abilities from overshadowing other party members.

### **BACKLASH AND PSYCHIC STRAIN**

When psychic forces resist your attempts to channel them, the resulting backlash can cause lasting strain that affects your character's capabilities until recovery occurs. Understanding how strain accumulates and recovers helps you manage risk while pursuing ambitious psychic goals.

#### **Backlash Occurs When:**

- Your final successful Psi roll exceeds your current Aura level
- You suffer a critical failure on any Psi roll
- Certain environmental hazards or psychic attacks affect you

#### **Backlash Effects**

When backlash occurs:
- Advance 1 step on your Psychic Strain track
- Your Aura level remains at its current value (no reduction)
- Roll on optional Feedback Effects table for additional complications

#### **Psychic Strain Track**

Characters can sustain strain according to their mental resilience:

- **Strain 1-3**: No mechanical penalties (uncomfortable but manageable)
- **Strain 4**: Psychically incapacitated (no Powered abilities until recovery)
- **Strain 5**: Unconscious from psychic overload

This track operates independently of your Health track, representing mental rather than physical damage. Characters might be physically unharmed but psychically exhausted, or conversely, wounded in body but mentally sharp and capable of using their abilities normally.

#### **Strain Recovery Options**

**Natural Recovery**: 1 strain removes per day of complete rest from psychic activity.

**Meditation**: Spend 1 hour in concentration and make a NERVE check. Success removes 1 strain and resets Aura to 100. Special Success also makes your next Psi roll immune to Aura effects. Critical Success provides this immunity for two rolls.

**Empathic Healing**: Skilled empaths can transfer strain from other psychics to themselves, converting 1 strain into 1 wound. This requires a successful Empathy check and willing cooperation from both parties.

**Self-Conversion**: Make a GRIT check to convert 1 of your own strain into 1 wound, representing the mental discipline to transform psychic stress into manageable physical discomfort.

These recovery options create interesting tactical choices about resource management and mutual support among psychic characters. They also provide mechanical justification for the meditation practices and supportive communities that characterize psychic culture in the atomic age.

### **RESISTANCE AND OPPOSED ROLLS**

When psionic powers target unwilling subjects, natural mental defenses create resistance that must be overcome through superior psychic force. This system ensures that psychic abilities enhance rather than replace social interaction and conventional problem-solving approaches.

#### **Resistance Attributes by Power Type**

Targets resist psionic powers using their most appropriate attribute:

- **BRAWN**: Against telekinetic forces attempting physical manipulation
- **REFLEX**: Against powers requiring quick mental reactions or evasion
- **NERVE**: Against fear projection, emotional manipulation, or psychic pressure  
- **SAVVY**: Against illusions, false sensory input, or deceptive suggestions
- **CHARM**: Against manipulation of social dynamics or personal connections
- **GRIT**: Against direct mental attacks, pain induction, or psychic domination
- **GUILE**: Against mind reading, memory extraction, or deception detection

#### **Resolution Process**

1. **Psychic makes Psi Skill roll** accumulating required successes
2. **Target makes resistance roll** using appropriate attribute
3. **Compare outcomes** to determine final result

**Both succeed**: Higher successful roll wins
**Psychic succeeds, target fails**: Power works completely  
**Both fail**: No effect occurs, no Aura change
**Psychic fails, target succeeds**: Target may sense the attempt

This creates meaningful tactical choices about when to use psychic abilities versus conventional approaches. A skilled interrogator might prefer traditional techniques over telepathy when facing a strong-willed subject, while psychic powers become more attractive against targets with weak mental defenses.

### **SUCCESS QUALITY AND ENHANCED EFFECTS**

Psionic abilities follow the same success quality system as other skills, but exceptional results can produce effects that stretch the boundaries of what seems possible within scientific frameworks.

#### **Enhanced Effect Examples**

**Critical Success (Doubles under skill)**: Duration doubled, range extended, or additional beneficial side effects occur.

**Special Success (Roll ending in 0 or 5)**: More information gained than expected, smoother implementation with less strain, or subtle additional benefits.

These enhanced effects should feel like natural extensions of the character's growing mastery rather than arbitrary mechanical bonuses. A critical success on telepathy might provide emotional context along with thoughts, while a special success on telekinesis could accomplish the task with particular elegance or efficiency.

### **PROFESSIONAL SPECIALIZATIONS**

Each psionic profession represents a different approach to developing psychic abilities, reflecting both natural aptitude and intensive training in specialized techniques.

#### **Mentalist**
*Masters of mind-to-mind contact and mental influence*

Professional Focus: Telepathy +40%, all others +0%, Telekinesis -10%
Secondary Skills: Psychology +20%, Rhine Institute Protocols +10%

Mentalists excel at the subtle arts of mental contact and influence. They understand the complex rhythms of thought and emotion that make telepathic contact possible, often serving as communicators, negotiators, and investigators within psychic communities. Their weakness with telekinesis stems from focusing so intensively on mental rather than physical phenomena.

#### **Telekinetic**
*Masters of moving matter through mental force*  

Professional Focus: Telekinesis +40%, all others +0%, Empathy -10%
Secondary Skills: Physics +20%, Fine Motor Control +10%

Telekineticists approach psychic abilities with an engineer's precision, understanding the mechanical principles that govern how mental force affects physical objects. They often work in construction, manufacturing, or technical fields where their abilities complement conventional tools. Their emotional distance can make empathy difficult.

#### **Precog**
*Seers who glimpse potential futures*

Professional Focus: Precognition +40%, all others +0%, Teleportation -10%  
Secondary Skills: Pattern Recognition +20%, Probability Theory +10%

Precogs develop heightened sensitivity to the subtle patterns that suggest future developments. They excel as planners, advisors, and risk assessors, but their focus on temporal rather than spatial relationships makes teleportation particularly challenging.

#### **Empath**
*Specialists in emotional perception and manipulation*

Professional Focus: Empathy +40%, all others +0%, Telekinesis -10%
Secondary Skills: Psychology +20%, Counseling +10%

Empaths serve as counselors, diplomats, and social coordinators within psychic communities. Their deep understanding of emotional dynamics makes them invaluable for resolving conflicts and maintaining group harmony, but their sensitivity can interfere with the mechanical precision required for telekinesis.

#### **Teleporter**
*Masters of spatial displacement*

Professional Focus: Teleportation +40%, all others +0%, Telepathy -10%
Secondary Skills: Spatial Awareness +20%, Emergency Procedures +10%

Teleporters excel at rapid movement and spatial manipulation, often serving as couriers, scouts, or emergency responders. Their focus on immediate spatial relationships can make the sustained mental contact required for telepathy particularly difficult.

#### **Wild Talent**
*Unpredictable psychics with broad but unfocused abilities*

Professional Limitation: All disciplines at -20%
Special Ability: Roll on Wild Talent Table for one unique power
Secondary Skills: Choose any two skills +20% and +10%

Wild Talents represent psychics whose abilities developed without formal training or clear specialization. While weaker in standard applications, they often manifest unusual powers that don't fit conventional categories—perhaps seeing through electronic surveillance, communicating with artificial intelligences, or affecting quantum probability directly.

### **THE RHINE INSTITUTE**

Founded in 1976 following government recognition of potentially dangerous uncontrolled psychics, the Rhine Institute maintains facilities throughout the solar system and serves as the primary regulatory body for psionic activity.

#### **Institute Functions**

**Identification**: Systematic testing for psionic potential among the general population, often conducted during routine educational or medical screenings.

**Training**: Structured development programs that teach safe power use, ethical guidelines, and integration with non-psychic society.

**Certification**: Official licensing that permits legal use of psionic abilities for commercial, investigative, or professional purposes.

**Regulation**: Oversight and intervention capabilities for situations involving dangerous or illegal psychic activity.

**Research**: Ongoing study of psionic phenomena, development of new applications, and investigation of psychic-related incidents.

**Protection**: Resources and safe havens for psychics facing discrimination, psychic predators, or loss of control over their abilities.

#### **Legal Framework**

In most jurisdictions, unlicensed psionic activity violates regulations similar to those governing radioactive materials or advanced weaponry. Particularly restricted activities include:

- Commercial applications without proper certification
- Investigation or surveillance without legal authority  
- Mental influence against unwilling subjects
- Gathering classified or protected information
- Any use that violates others' privacy or autonomy

Licensed Espers receive credentials indicating their training level and authorized applications, similar to medical or engineering licenses. This creates interesting roleplay opportunities around the tension between natural abilities and legal restrictions, especially for characters whose psychic gifts emerged outside formal training programs.

### **EXTENDED EXAMPLE OF PLAY**

**Dr. Sarah Voss, Mentalist (Psi Skill 65%, Current Aura: 100, Strain: 0)**

*The space station's corridors echo with tension as Dr. Voss approaches the suspected smuggler. Station security has been ineffective, but direct telepathic investigation requires careful handling to avoid legal complications.*

**GM**: "The dockworker, Martinez, is clearly nervous about something. He keeps glancing toward Cargo Bay 7. Reading surface thoughts of an unaware target requires 1 success."

**Player**: "I'll try to pick up what's making him so worried."

*Rolls 43 - Success under 65%*

**GM**: "You sense his anxiety centers on 'the shipment in Bay 7' and something about 'Rhine Institute seals.' Since 43 is under your Aura of 100, no backlash risk. Your Aura drops to 43."

*Later, after discovering Rhine Institute contraband, Dr. Voss attempts a deeper probe (3 successes needed)*

**Player**: "I need to know who's behind this smuggling operation. I'll probe his recent memories."

*First roll: 51 (success, 1 total). Second roll: 28 (success, 2 total). Third roll: 67 (success, 3 total)*

**GM**: "You successfully access his memories and learn the operation connects to a corrupt Institute inspector on Mars. However, your final roll of 67 exceeds your current Aura of 43, so you suffer backlash. Advance 1 step on your Strain track, and your Aura remains at 43."

**Player**: "That psychic feedback is going to impair me. I want to convert the strain to physical damage so I can keep operating effectively."

*Rolls GRIT check: 34, success*

**GM**: "You force the psychic stress to manifest physically—your nose starts bleeding and you feel a sharp headache, but your mental clarity returns. Take 1 wound and reduce your strain to 0."

This example demonstrates the risk-reward dynamics that make psionic abilities tactically interesting. Early success with high Aura made the initial probe safe and effective. The subsequent deep probe succeeded but at considerable cost, forcing the character to make difficult choices about resource management. The conversion of strain to wounds represents the kind of gritty determination that characterizes heroes in the atomic age.

### **INCORPORATING PSIONICS INTO YOUR CAMPAIGN**

Psionic abilities work best when they enhance rather than overshadow conventional problem-solving approaches. The Aura system naturally creates this balance by making repeated power use increasingly risky, encouraging psychic characters to rely on teamwork, preparation, and conventional skills alongside their special abilities.

Consider psionics as tools that create new storytelling opportunities rather than shortcuts around existing challenges. A telepath still benefits from conventional interrogation skills; their abilities just provide additional options and information sources. A telekinetic still needs to understand physics and engineering; their powers simply offer alternative implementation methods.

The legal and social framework around the Rhine Institute creates numerous adventure hooks and roleplay opportunities. Characters might work as licensed Institute agents, operate as unlicensed rogues avoiding official attention, or navigate the complex relationship between psychic abilities and conventional law enforcement. These dynamics help integrate psionic abilities into the broader social and political landscape of the atomic age.

Remember that not all problems require psionic solutions, and not all psionic applications require mechanical resolution. The most compelling psychic characters are those whose abilities feel natural and integrated rather than mechanically dominant, contributing to group success while maintaining the collaborative spirit that makes the atomic tomorrow special.
