## VENUS LANDMARK DECK SYSTEM

### SUIT MEANINGS

**♠ SPADES (Ancient/Mysterious)** - Forerunner ruins, ancient structures, mysterious phenomena

**♥ HEARTS (Life/Organic)** - Massive trees, distinctive flora, biological features

**♣ CLUBS (Human/Settlement)** - Outposts, camps, crashed vehicles, human structures

**♦ DIAMONDS (Geological/Mineral)** - Rock formations, crystal outcrops, mineral deposits



### VISIBILITY RULE

**Cards 2-10**: Visible landmark in that direction **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Nothing distinctive visible (dense jungle/mist) **Aces**: Major landmark visible (use higher value interpretation). Even in High Visibility areas, players must take some positive action such as climbing a tree or local promontory or send a drone or balloon aloft in order to spot/stay oriented towards distant landmarks (just to prevent having to continuously generate and discard them as they travel).

### FACE CARDS (Dense Jungle)

- **All Jacks, Queens, Kings**: "Dense jungle canopy blocks distant visibility"

## USAGE IN PLAY

1. **Draw card when players gain elevated position or clear sightline**
2. **GM randomly rotates card before looking** to determine which direction (Top of card indicates approximate direction)
3. **Describe landmark using suit theme and card value as size/importance guide**
4. **Players can choose to investigate or use for navigation reference**

### EXAMPLE OF PLAY

*Players climb a tall tree to get their bearings*

**GM draws 7♥, randomly orients it with hearts pointing "east"**

**GM**: "Looking east through the mist, you spot something remarkable - a magnificent waterfall cascading down from what appears to be a cluster of massive trees growing on different levels. The water catches the golden Venusian light as it falls."

**Player**: "That might be a good source of fresh water. Can we navigate toward it?"

**GM**: "With that distinctive landmark, you can definitely maintain your bearing in that direction."
