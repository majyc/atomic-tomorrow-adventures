You're absolutely right! I need to clarify the distinction between Maneuverability and Thrust. Let me revise to reflect that Maneuverability affects Vector changes while Thrust affects Velocity changes.

# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: ROCKET SHIP CATALOG (REVISED)

## MANEUVERABILITY & Thrust SYSTEM

**Maneuverability:** Determines a ship's ability to change Vector (directional heading)

- **Sluggish (-20%):** Bulk freighters, colony ships
- **Standard (0%):** Typical civilian and cargo vessels
- **Nimble (+20%):** Patrol ships and specialized vessels
- **Lightning (+40%):** Scouts, racers, and interceptors

**Thrust (TH):** Determines a ship's ability to change Velocity (Speed)

- **TH 1 (Underpowered):** Bulk freighters, orbital tugs
- **TH 2 (Standard):** Most commercial vessels
- **TH 3 (High-Thrust):** Military vessels, couriers
- **TH 4 (Afterburner):** Interceptors, racing ships
- **TH 5 (Experimental):** Racing craft and prototypes

During Vector Combat:

- **Maneuverability** modifies Vector Change Maneuvers
- **Thrust** modifies Velocity Change Maneuvers
- When performing Combined Maneuvers, use the worse of the two modifiers
