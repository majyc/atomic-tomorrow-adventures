# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: SHIP COMPLICATIONS

Each complication reduces a ship's cost by 25%. Four or more complications means the ship is essentially available for scrap value. Many complications involve engineering checks or specific interpretations of the percentile dice:

- **Ones Die**: The d10 representing the 1-9 position (full range of values)
- **Tens Die**: The d10 representing the 10-90 position (often skews toward lower values in bounded checks)

## HIT LOCATION CHART (d10)

When a ship is hit and neither Command Decision nor Precision Shot has determined the target system, roll 1d10:

| Roll | System Hit |
|------|------------|
| 1 | Propulsion |
| 2 | Weapons |
| 3 | Power |
| 4 | Sensors |
| 5 | Life Support |
| 6 | Communications |
| 7 | Structure |
| 8 | Cargo Systems |
| 9 | Med-Bay |
| 0 | Crew/Passenger Quarters |

*Note: Roll d10 when determining which system takes damage. A result of 0 represents 10 (Crew/Passenger Quarters).*

## MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS

### CHEMICAL X UNSTABLE

*"The fuel injectors need constant coaxing, like a nervous racehorse."*

- Engine occasionally generates unpredictable power surges
- When a Pilot is making a Velocity Change Maneuver
  - On success: System functions normally
  - On failure: Velocity die changes by one more (if trying to increase) or less (if trying to decrease) than was intended, minimum of 0.
  - On a critical failure: Velocity die changes by one less, and Vector changes by one randomly (odd rolls up, even rolls down)
- Affects combat, landings, and docking procedures

### MISALIGNED GYROS

*"She pulls to starboard. Always has. You get used to it."*

- Ship constantly drifts off course without corrections
- -20% to all Vector maneuvers.
- Each trip requires a successful Piloting check or the ship veers off course, adding the ones digit times 10 as a percentage to the travel time (1 = 10% up to 9 = 90%)

### TEMPERAMENTAL

*"The drive ignition's got a personality. Sometimes you've got to sweet-talk it a little."*

- Nothing is actually wrong with the ship's systems, but they require finesse
- When rolling exactly your target number on any ship system check, the system activates but then immediately shuts down
- When rolling crictical  or special success (11, 22, 33, or ending in 5 or 0 etc.) on ship operation checks, the system requires a second successful check to confirm the critical
  - failure on the second check transforms the success into an ordinary success, not a failure.

### GREMLINS

*"I swear I fixed that same hatch three times this week!"*

* Nothing stays fixed, and things that can't break sometimes break
* On any successful repair attempt that's not an automatic success (01-05) the GM should secretly roll an d100 and if the score on that exceeds the score of the success, the system will break again next time it's used in a skill check.

### HANGAR QUEEN

*"She's high-maintenance, but she's worth it... most days."*

- Systems constantly break down despite regular maintenance
- Required maintenance takes twice as long and costs 50% more than standard
- If routine maintenance is skipped, on first use after it's due Engineer must check the system at -40%
  - Critical failures on repair rolls cause one additional random system to fail

### FAULTY LIFE SUPPORT

*"Don't mind the whistling sound. Just wear your emergency rebreather during sleep cycles."*

- Atmosphere recyclers operate at minimal efficiency
- Life support can only handle 75% of the ship's rated capacity
- Every 24 hours, Engineer must make an Engineering (Life Support) check
  - On failure, life support partially fails and requires repairs taking hours equal to the ones die

### UNSTABLE POWER GRID

*"Never run the kitchen unit and the weapons systems at the same time unless you want to eat in the dark."*

- Cannot operate all systems simultaneously
- Running more than half of ship's systems requires an Engineering (Power Systems) check
  - Failed check causes power fluctuations affecting a number of systems equal to the ones die
  - Special failures (rolls ending in 5 or 0 above skill percentage) cause ship-wide blackout

### LEAKY HULL

*"We installed extra patch kits in every corridor. You'll need them."*

- Ship develops minor hull breaches during normal stress
- Any critical failure on a Piloting check causes a small hull breach
  - The ones die on the failed roll indicates how many compartments are affected
- Increases cost of life support refills by 25%

### RADIATION HOTSPOTS

*"Don't store the film in the cargo bay, and don't spend more than an hour in section C-7."*

- Certain areas of the ship emit concerning levels of radiation
  - roll % for each compartment when this complication first comes up, doubles indicates a hot spot. If none come up, then the reactor room is it.
- Characters in hotspots must make a GRIT check when entering and every hour
  - On failure, character experiences radiation effects lasting hours equal to the ones die
- Electronics used in hotspots require a Technology check or malfunction for minutes equal to the ones die

## OPERATIONAL COMPLICATIONS

### BIZARRE CONTROL LAYOUT

*"The landing gear is activated by that toggle under the navigation panel. Don't ask why."*

- Controls arranged in counterintuitive or nonsensical configurations
- Any pilot other than the primary suffers -40% on all Piloting checks
- Even the regular pilot has a chance of flipping the wrong lever under stress
  - when rolling a skill roll, automatic misses (96+) are also critical misses.
  - Special failures activate the wrong system entirely (the ones die determines which unintended system activates)

### IDIOSYNCRATIC COMPUTER

*"The navigation system works fine as long as you don't ask it for the shortest route or use the word 'calculate'."*

- Ship's computer has peculiar quirks that must be worked around
- On any failed Computer Systems check, the computer misinterprets commands
  - The ones die determines the severity of the misinterpretation:
    - Even: Minor inconvenience
    - Divisible by 3: Moderate problem requiring correction
    - 1: Severe misinterpretation with potential danger
    - 7: Lucky! No bad consequences

### ANCIENT OPERATING SYSTEM

*"The diagnostics were programmed before the Martian colonies. It still lists 'check pneumatic tubes' in the start-up sequence."*

- Ship runs on outdated and incompatible software
- Modern equipment requires jury-rigging to interface with systems
- Updates and patches are impossible; workarounds must be created
- Modern mechanics and engineers suffer -20% on all repair attempts

### INCONSISTENT SENSORS

*"Is that an asteroid or a sensor ghost? Better swerve anyway."*

- Sensors regularly produce false readings or miss hazards
- During significant sensor scans, operator must make a Technology (Sensors) check
  - On success with roll with an Odd tens die: Generates false phantom contacts equal to the ones die
- Critical failures produce completely inverted readings

### TEMPERAMENTAL AIRLOCKS

*"Count to three after hitting the button, then kick the lower panel. Works every time."*

- Airlocks occasionally malfunction, either failing to open or seal properly
- Each use requires a Technology check; failure means manual override required
  - The time required for override equals the ones die in minutes
- During critical situations, airlocks may activate unexpectedly on a critical failed Engineering check on some other system

### UNRELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS

*"If the signal drops, try standing on the port thruster housing and holding the antenna."*

- Communications regularly drop out or become garbled
- Range is reduced by 50% compared to similar vessels
- During critical communications, operator must make a Technology (Communications) check
  - On failure, communications drop and require minutes equal to the ones die to restore

## REPUTATION COMPLICATIONS

*"That's the ship that was involved in the Luna City Incident of '97. I thought they scrapped it."*

- Ship was previously involved in a famous disaster, crime, or scandal
- Authorities conduct extra-thorough inspections at every port
- Some stations may refuse docking privileges entirely
- Previous owners or victims may seek retribution

### BLACK FLAG REPUTATION

*"You came in that? You're braver than you look."*

- Ship is rumored to be unlucky, haunted, or cursed
- -20% to all Persuasion checks when hiring crew or passengers
- Merchants require successful Persuasion at -20% to agree to ship cargo

### MILITARY SURPLUS

*"Sure it's got great armor, but expect the Space Patrol to stop you at every junction."*

- Ship was decommissioned from military service
- When entering a new jurisdiction, make a Social check at -20%
- On failure, the ship is stopped for inspection
- Inspection thoroughness determined by the ones die:
  - Even: Cursory check (minutes)
  - Divisible by 3: Detailed inspection (hours)
  - 1: Exhaustive search (potentially days)
  - 7: Lucky! No bad consequences
- Some systems locked behind military codes requiring Security checks at -20%

### CORPORATE PROPERTY

*"Technically, we're just 'long-term borrowing' it from MegaCorp Industries."*

- Ship legally belongs to a corporation but is in your possession
- Could be legitimately leased, "borrowed," or outright stolen
- After each adventure, make a Deception check at -20%
  - On failure, corporate agents appear to investigate
    - The ones die determines how many agents arrive
    - The tens die determines their authority level (Even low, Divisible by 3 mid, 1 executive, 7 Lucky!)

### EXOTIC ORIGIN

*"The previous owner was a Venusian diplomat. The sonic shower still releases spores."*

- Ship designed for alien or unusual occupants
- Systems and controls require adaptation for human use (-20% to unfamiliar operations)
- Replacement parts must be custom-manufactured (doubles repair time)
- When dealing with authorities, make a Social or Persuasion check
  - On special failure, they quarantine the ship for days equal to the tens die

### REGISTERED TO CRIMINAL

*"The paperwork says we're the 'Sunny Day Shipping Company,' but patrol ships call us 'The Pirate Express'."*

  - On a critical failure, previous owner's enemies target the ship
  - Threat level determined by tens die (Even minor, Divisible by 3 serious, 1 critical, 7 Lucky!)

## BIZARRE COMPLICATIONS

### ROGUE AI

*"The chess program evolved somehow. Now it runs environmentals and insists we call it 'Deep Thought'."*

- Ship contains a semi-sentient but limited AI that wasn't supposed to exist
- When using AI-controlled systems, make a Computer Systems check
  - On a critical failure: AI suggests an alternative action
    - The ones die indicates how strongly it insists (Even: suggestion, Divisible by 3: strong urging, 1: refusal, 7: Lucky!)
    - On an automatic failure: AI briefly takes control to "optimize" the operation

### DIMENSIONAL ANOMALY

*"Don't open storage locker B-7. What goes in doesn't come out the same... if it comes out at all."*

- A specific area of the ship exhibits strange spatial properties
- Objects placed inside may disappear, change, or emerge elsewhere
- When using the anomalous space, make a Science (Physics) check
  - On success: The anomaly can be temporarily stabilized for safe use
  - On failure: look at the ones die for the effect:
    - Even: Object appears elsewhere on the ship
    - Divisible by 3: Object vanishes for hours equal to the tens die
    - 1: Object changes size or properties
    - 7: Lucky? Something else emerges instead

### TEMPORAL HICCUPS

*"Ship's chronometer says we've been traveling for three days, but Earth says it's been a week."*

- Ship occasionally experiences brief time slips or distortions
- Internal clocks never synchronize with external timepieces
- After long journeys, make an Engineering (Navigation) check
  - On success: Arrive roughly when expected (minor discrepancies)
  - On special failure: Arrive later than expected (tens die in hours)
  - On critical failure: Arrive later than expected (tens die in days)

### EMPATHIC SYSTEMS

*"The ship doesn't like it when we argue. The lights dim and the temperature drops until we make up."*

- Ship systems seem to respond to crew emotions
- During high emotional situations, Engineer must make an Engineering check
  - On a special or critical failure, ship systems react to emotions
  - The ones die determines which systems are affected comparing against the standard to-hit chart
  - The penalty to the affeced system is 20%
- Performance improves (+10%) when crew morale is high, as determined by the GM.

### SPACE VERMIN

*"They're not rats, exactly. More like... well, we don't know what they are, but they chew on the wiring."*

- Ship is home to strange creatures that cannot be eradicated
- Weekly, Engineer must make a Perception check to monitor activity
- On special failure: They damage a system (tens die determines which one)
- On critical failure: They appear to have fixed something that was broken
- Attempts to communicate with or train them require Animal Handling checks
- Seem to understand human speech but cannot communicate

### MYSTERY ROOM

*"According to the blueprints, this corridor should end right here. So why is there a door?"*

- Ship contains a room or compartment not on any official plans
- When seeking the room, make a Perception check
- On success, the room can be found
- On special success, contents have changed since last visit

    - Even: Empty except for strange markings, environment differs slightly from the rest of ship (humidity, heat, oxygen level)
    - Divisible by 3: Filled with obsolete equipment
    - 1: Signs of recent occupation by unknown entities
    - 7: Lucky! Contains a single mysterious artifact
- Previous owners left no explanation for its existence

## COMBINING COMPLICATIONS

When applying multiple complications to a single ship, create a narrative that connects them:

### EXAMPLE 1: THE RUSTY VENTURE

**Complications**: Leaky Hull + Notorious History + Radiation Hotspots
**Narrative**: Once the pride of the solar express route, this vessel suffered a catastrophic reactor breach ten years ago. Hastily repaired to avoid bankruptcy, the ship now sports slapdash patching throughout its hull and several areas remain dangerously radioactive. Its reputation ensures it can only find work on desperate frontier routes.

### EXAMPLE 2: THE PHANTOM ECHO

**Complications**: Unreliable Communications + Mystery Room + Temperamental
**Narrative**: Purchased at a military auction, this scout ship came with a sealed compartment that doesn't appear on any diagrams. Since the crew discovered and opened it, the communication system regularly picks up transmissions from nowhere, and previously reliable systems now require precise timing and the occasional physical persuasion to function.

### EXAMPLE 3: THE PERSISTENT PROBLEM

**Complications**: Hangar Queen + Idiosyncratic Computer + Empathic Systems
**Narrative**: This vessel seems almost deliberately difficult, requiring constant maintenance and developing new issues faster than they can be repaired. The computer requires specific phrasing for even basic functions, and strangest of all, the entire ship seems to perform better when the crew is in good spirits but becomes obstinate when tensions rise.

These complications should create interesting narrative hooks and gameplay challenges without making ships completely non-functional. Each one offers both problems and potential story opportunities for bold crews in the atomic tomorrow!
