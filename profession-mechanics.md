## SKILL RANGES FOR REFERENCE

With this system, skill percentages will typically fall in these ranges:

**For characters with average attributes (9-12):**

- Primary skills: 58-64% (40% + 9-12 × 2)
- Secondary skills: 38-44% (20% + 9-12 × 2)
- Tertiary skills: 28-34% (10% + 9-12 × 2)

**For characters with exceptional attributes (16-18):**

- Primary skills: 72-76% (40% + 16-18 × 2)
- Secondary skills: 52-56% (20% + 16-18 × 2)
- Tertiary skills: 42-46% (10% + 16-18 × 2)

This creates a system where professional training is the primary determinant of skill competency, with attributes providing a meaningful but secondary contribution.
