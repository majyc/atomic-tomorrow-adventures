You're absolutely right - let's dial back the visibility to make it more streamlined and exploration-focused. Here's the revised approach with tiered visibility:

# ATOMIC TOMORROW: FRONTIER HEXPLORATION SYSTEM

## VISIBILITY TIERS & CARD DRAWING

### Low Visibility Terrain (Jungle, Canyons, Fog)

* **Draw NO feature cards**
* Can only see current hex
* Must follow terrain features or make navigation checks
* Examples: Dense Venusian jungle, Martian dust storm areas, Mercury crevasse fields

### Standard Visibility Terrain (Plains, Desert, Hills)

* **Draw ONE feature card**
* Card shows what's visible from current position
* Can make informed decisions about one direction
* Examples: Martian plains, Venus plateaus, Mercury flats

### High Visibility Terrain (Mountains, Towers, Plateaus)

* **Draw ONE feature card**
* Can determine adjacent terrain with hex flower rolls before moving
* Strategic advantage in planning
* Examples: Mountain peaks, observation towers, elevated plateaus

## STREAMLINED EXPLORATION PROCEDURE

### 1. ENTER NEW HEX

* GM rolls on appropriate hex flower for terrain type
* Places terrain index card on growing map
* Draws feature card ONLY if visibility permits

### 2. DETERMINE WHAT'S VISIBLE

Based on visibility tier:

* **Low** : Nothing beyond current hex
* **Standard** : Features on ONE direction card
* **High** : Features on ONE direction card + adjacent terrain types (hex flower rolls)

### 3. PLAYER DECISIONS

* Choose which visible feature to move toward (if any)
* Explore current hex thoroughly or move on
* Navigate using visible features or planetary navigation aids

## THE MULTI-FEATURE CARD

Each feature card shows 1-4 visible features positioned around card edges:

* Position indicates relative direction from current hex
* Only drawn when visibility allows
* Randomly rotated before revealing

This minimalist approach creates meaningful exploration with minimal drawing while still maintaining the fog of war that makes exploration exciting.

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

 **GM** : "You've landed in a Martian canyon. This is low visibility terrain, so you can only see what's in your immediate hex - red rock walls rising on either side, a dry riverbed beneath your feet, and some ancient carvings on the canyon wall."

 **Player 1** : "Let's follow the canyon and see where it leads. Seems like a natural path."

 **GM** : "You follow the winding canyon for several hours. I'll roll on the hex flower to determine where it leads." *Rolls* "The canyon gradually widens and opens into a broad Martian plain. This is standard visibility terrain."

*Places new terrain card*

*Draws and randomly rotates one multi-feature card*

"From this vantage point, you can see an abandoned outpost to the north, strange rock formations to the southeast, and what appears to be a dust storm on the horizon to the west."

 **Player 2** : "The outpost might have supplies or information. Let's head that way."

 **GM** : "You travel north toward the outpost. I'll roll on the hex flower again." *Rolls* "As you approach, you find yourself in rocky badlands terrain with the outpost sitting atop a small rise."

*Places new terrain card*

"This is still standard visibility terrain, so I'll draw one feature card again."

*Draws and rotates feature card*

"From here, you can see a glinting object that might be a crashed ship to the northeast, a dried canal to the northwest, and a strange red haze to the east."

 **Player 3** : "Let's explore the outpost thoroughly before moving on."

 **GM** : *Draws Opportunity Card* "Searching the outpost, you find an old solar-powered radio relay station. It's been abandoned for years, but some of the equipment might still be salvageable. You also discover a weathered map showing the locations of several other outposts in the region."

 **Player 1** : "After we finish here, I want to head up that rise to the south - it looks like it might give us better visibility of the surrounding area."

 **GM** : "You climb the rocky hill south of the outpost. This elevated position counts as high visibility terrain."

*Draws one feature card*

"From this vantage point, you can see a massive crater to the south with what appears to be some kind of structure at its center, a dust canyon to the southeast, and the glint of water or ice to the southwest."

"Since this is high visibility terrain, you can also get a sense of the surrounding landscape. I'll roll on the hex flower for the adjacent hexes."

*Rolls for adjacent hexes*

"The area to the south appears to be impact crater terrain, to the southeast is dust canyon, to the southwest is a small oasis, and the other directions are various types of rocky plains.

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY WITH SUCCESS QUALITY

 **GM** : "You're faced with two options: a network of canyons leading east or a plateau to the north."

 **Player 1** : "I want to climb the plateau to get a better view of the surrounding area. I'll use my Athletics (Climbing) skill."

*Rolls 33 on Athletics 65% - Ordinary Success*

 **GM** : "You make it to the top of the plateau without incident. From this elevated position, you can see one additional hex in each direction. To the northeast, you spot what appears to be some kind of structure glinting in the sunlight."

 **Player 2** : "I want to use my Science (Geography) skill to analyze the landscape and determine the best route forward."

*Rolls 15 on Science 75% - Special Success (ends in 5)*

 **GM** : "With your knowledge of Martian geography, you're able to determine that the canyon system below likely leads to an ancient lake bed. Water would have flowed from the mountains to the east down toward the western plains. You also identify two additional hexes of terrain - the area to the east appears to be rocky highlands, while the southeast looks like it might be an impact crater."

 **Player 3** : "Before we leave the plateau, I want to set up our navigation equipment to establish this as a reference point."

*Rolls 44 on Technology 60% - Critical Success (doubles under skill)*

 **GM** : "You set up a perfect reference marker. This plateau is now permanently marked on your navigation system, and you'll automatically succeed on any navigation checks when traveling to or from this location. Additionally, you've calibrated your equipment so well that you can determine the terrain types for all adjacent hexes."

This implementation maintains the core success quality system of Atomic Tomorrow while creating meaningful decisions with tangible advantages and complications. Each landmark type offers distinct gameplay effects that make exploration strategic rather than arbitrary.

## VENUS: THE JUNGLE WORLD

### Venusian Environmental Factors

* **Endural Treatment** : Players using Endural can operate in Venus pressure with minimal penalties
* **Weak Magnetosphere** : Compasses unreliable
* **Perpetual Cloud Cover** : Navigation by stars or satellites remains impossible
* **Lush Vegetation** : Thick jungle canopies limit visibility in many areas
* **Retro-Pulp Bio-hazards** : Focus on exotic flora/fauna rather than pressure/acid hazards

### Venus Navigation Methods (Revised)

* **Bio-Navigation** : Learning to read distinctive plant patterns and animal migration routes
* **Natural Landmarks** : Massive trees, crystal formations, and distinctive geographic features
* **Indigenous Guidance Systems** : Methods used by native Venusians to traverse the jungles
* **Water Current Mapping** : Following the planet's extensive river systems

This revised approach embraces the atomic-age pulp version of Venus as a lush jungle world where Endural allows exploration but still maintains the unique navigational challenges of a cloud-covered planet with no magnetic navigation.

## PLANET-SPECIFIC HEX EXPLORATION TRAITS

### Venus Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Smaller (dense foliage limits visibility)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Visual landmarks and bio-signs instead of technical instruments
* **Unique Advantage** : Abundant natural resources (food, water, medicinal plants)
* **Primary Hazard** : Exotic life forms and territorial species
* **Discovery Focus** : Biological specimens, ancient ruins, strange plant phenomena

### Mars Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Medium (clear atmosphere but varied terrain)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Dust storms that reconfigure landmarks
* **Unique Advantage** : Ancient canal system provides reliable navigation framework
* **Primary Hazard** : Resource scarcity and ancient defense systems
* **Discovery Focus** : Forerunner technology, water sources, Red Martian artifacts

### Mercury Exploration

* **Hex Size** : Large (excellent visibility but extreme range of conditions)
* **Navigation Challenge** : Day/night cycle creates drastically different landscapes
* **Unique Advantage** : Rich mineral deposits and unmatched solar power
* **Primary Hazard** : Extreme temperature fluctuations
* **Discovery Focus** : Rare metals, untouched geological formations, stellar observation points

The exploration system now embraces the retro-futuristic vision of the Solar System where Venus is a jungle paradise (with appropriate challenges), Mars is a dying world of ancient canals and lost civilizations, and Mercury is a world of extremes with valuable resources for those hardy enough to brave its conditions.

Is this more aligned with the Atomic Tomorrow vision of Venus you're creating?

# ATOMIC TOMORROW: PLANETARY HEX SCALES & TRAVEL RATES

## EARTH (BASELINE)

* **Standard Hex Size** : 2 miles (approximately 3.2 km) across
* **Standard Travel Rate** : 3-4 hexes per day on foot through average terrain
* **Vehicle Travel Rate** : 6-10 hexes per day with ground vehicles on established paths

Using these Earth values as our foundation, let's adjust for the different planetary conditions:

## VENUS

* **Hex Size** : 1 mile (approximately 1.6 km)
* **Rationale** : Dense jungle and limited visibility require smaller-scale mapping
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: 2-3 hexes per day (slower due to vegetation but standard gravity)
* River Travel: 4-6 hexes per day following waterways
* Hovercraft: 5-7 hexes per day in cleared areas
* **Special Considerations** :
* Endural allows normal human exertion despite atmospheric conditions
* Certain plant species can be used as natural paths (fungal highways, vine bridges)
* Standing water and mud increase travel difficulty in lowland areas

## MARS

* **Hex Size** : 3 miles (approximately 4.8 km)
* **Rationale** : Lower gravity (38% of Earth) increases travel distance; clear air improves visibility
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: 4-6 hexes per day (benefit of lower gravity)
* Canal Routes: 5-7 hexes per day following ancient waterways
* Ground Vehicle: 8-12 hexes per day on established paths
* Thoat (Martian mount): 6-9 hexes per day across open terrain
* **Special Considerations** :
* Dust storms can reduce travel to 0-1 hexes during peak conditions
* Ancient roads and canal paths provide established travel routes
* Thin atmosphere means less stamina despite lower gravity

## MERCURY

* **Hex Size** : 4 miles (approximately 6.4 km)
* **Rationale** : Excellent visibility, lower gravity, but extreme conditions
* **Travel Methods** :
* On Foot: Variable by temperature conditions
  * Terminator Zone (dawn/dusk): 5-7 hexes per day
  * Day Side: 1-2 hexes per day (heat limitations)
  * Night Side: 2-3 hexes per day (energy consumption for heating)
* Skimmer: 10-15 hexes per day on smooth plains during optimal conditions
* **Special Considerations** :
* Day/night travel rates drastically different
* Must plan routes around thermal shelters
* Solar power abundance on day side can boost vehicle range

This approach grounds our exploration system in realistic movement rates while accommodating the pulpy science fantasy elements of Atomic Tomorrow. The varying hex sizes create distinct exploration experiences that match the planetary environments while remaining playable and intuitive.

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of these scales or travel methods?
