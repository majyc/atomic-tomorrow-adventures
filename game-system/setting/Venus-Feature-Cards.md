## Using These Cards in Play

1. **Draw and Orient:** When entering a new hex with standard or high visibility, draw one feature card and orient it randomly (or as desired for your narrative).
2. **Create Exploration Goals:** Players now have 1-3 distinctive features they can choose to explore, creating natural points of interest and forward momentum.
3. **Reuse with Variation:** These cards are designed to be reused throughout the journey. The same "massive crystal formation" could appear different when approached from various angles and contexts.
4. **Feature Discovery:** When players travel toward a visible feature, they arrive at the corresponding hex, which may contain additional details about that feature not visible from a distance.
