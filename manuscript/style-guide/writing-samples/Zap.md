Steps To Creating A Character for Zap! {#sec:CharSteps}
--------------------------------------

*Before you begin* the GM or entire group decides certain aspects
of the campaign, such as Scope, basic setting, Tone, and campaign
goals before character creation. For example, the campaign could be
light-hearted and set in a Space Cadet Academy, with most characters
being Academy students, a serious relatively hard SF campaign about
the crew of a interstellar scout ship seeking out new worlds and new
civilizations, a grim post-apocalyptic setting where the characters
are survivors of a devastating biological war, or even a "space
opera" western-in-space. This campaign information affects character
creation in informal ways, such as deciding that a hard bitten space
bounty hunter or a member of a semi-mystical order of Star Knights
is an appropriate character concept. There are also two mechanical
ways the campaign's design affects player character creation. First,
the Scope of the campaign will determine the personal power level
of the characters, at least at the beginning. Secondly, the GM will
decide on or create templates for standard creature types available
as player characters. For example, templates for particular alien
races means aliens PCs and NPCs will be relatively common, and specifies
what exactly is true of those aliens in the game.

### Before You Begin: Scope and Tone

Before you actually start creating characters, you need to make some
decisions about the kind of science fiction game you want to play.
The GM and the players should collectively decide on the Scope for
the adventures, and the Tone that the game will take. Is the group
going to be a rag-tag bunch of survivors of an apocalypse trying to
hang on one more day, the crew of a starship trying to eke a living
on the frontier or carry out missions assigned by Star Command, guardians
of an entire galaxy fighting a war against extra-galactic invaders,
or something else? Will the players be average Joes with some specialized
training and gear, elite commandos with state-of-the-art equipment,
futuristic supermen and women with psionic or technological powers
that grant them godlike abilities? Is death and dying something that
rarely happens to PCs, and can usually be "fixed" with appropriate
technology, or will it be a minor triumph if the PCs survive an adventure,
or somewhere in between?

### Adventure Scope and Personal Scope {#sec:Scope}

Scope describes how large an area the characters' typical adventures
take place in and how powerful they are individually. The Adventure
Scope refers to the size of the area they typically travel within
and is usually tied to their available means of transportation; the
Personal Scope refers to how much ability the individual characters
have to affect the outcomes of things within the area of the adventure.
The two are related, but not identical. For instance, it is common
in science fiction to have adventures take the heroes from star system
to star system, while the heroes themselves are little more than average
Joes and Janes who might find themselves mugged in a back-alley of
some starport if they're not careful; on the flip side, you have stories
like some Roger Zelazny novels such as *Lord of Light* where
the characters are literally godlike in power but the entire action
of the story is confined to one world. While campaigns may eventually
transcend the original Scopes, you should pick a Personal Scope at
the start that will be satisfactory to play for quite some time. Most
of the time in science fiction, characters who "level up" and
significantly change their Personal Scope either do so at the start,
and that's what kicks off their adventures, or gain great power at
the end and use it to resolve things\...it's relatively unusual to
have a sequels at the new level of power remain as interesting. Groups
that want to try different power levels as a change of pace might
consider creating new characters in the same setting but at the desired
Scope, and returning to the lower-powered characters when they feel
like more down-to-Earth adventures, rather than ramping up the original
characters with newly discovered powers, symbiotic alien tech, and
the like. On the other hand, Adventure Scopes regularly increase over
the course of science fiction stories, as the characters find themselves
visiting far-flung places and interacting with larger and larger areas
of the setting. Note that many famous SF characters, even ones who
regularly win fights, would only count as Scope 1 Normals. If you
can imagine the character actually needing to surrender or flee when
confronted with a fire-team of four soldiers with rifles leveled,
that character is probably Scope 1. Note also that characters may
be in command of ships or organizations well above their own in Scope.
The same shoulder-rolling starship Captain that finds it wise to surrender
to a fire team of four soldiers may command a vessel that could fight
an entire army, or even planet, on equal terms.

#### Adventure Scopes

1.  **Normal** Does not go on adventures unless pressed.

2.  **Agent** You are part of a large group that provides
    support, missions, and transportation. While you rarely make a crucial
    difference individually, your group works for larger aims. Organizations
    can themselves vary in Scope and power-level, but most of their operatives
    will still be at the agent power-level, whether they are the local
    police department or a world-conquering conspiracy. The differences
    will be in the number of agents, the equipment provided to the agents,
    and the number and level of higher-powered officers and specialists
    that work alongside them.

3.  **Street-level** You do not have reliable
    intel or transportation, so you need to plan ahead to be in the right
    place to influence events. Thus, your missions are usually chosen
    to suit your talents and centered on individuals, rather than responding
    to crises. Examples: *Damnation Alley, Escape from New York*.

4.  **Neighborhood** You adventure mainly in
    a city district or equivalent area, such as a small to medium-sized
    town. You have ways of learning about major events in your district,
    and reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to
    these events. Examples: *Eureka*.

5.  **City** You adventure mainly in a major metropolis.
    You have ways of learning about major events in your city, and reliable
    transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these events.
    Examples: *Sliders* (the city changes from episode to episode,
    but they never move far from the location of the vortex).

6.  **Regional** You adventure mainly in a geographical
    area, such as a group of US States (e.g., New England), a large US
    State (e.g., California) or a moderate-sized country (e.g., the Netherlands).
    You have ways of learning about major events in your region, and reliable
    transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these events.
    Examples: *Men in Black*.

7.  **National** You adventure throughout a large
    country (e.g., USA) or continent (e.g., Europe or Australia). You
    have ways of learning about major events anywhere in this area, and
    reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to these
    events. Examples: *Warehouse 13*.

8.  **Global** You adventure throughout the world.
    You have ways of learning about major events anywhere in the world,
    and reliable transportation that allows you to respond quickly to
    these events. Examples: *Thunderbirds*, *U.F.O*.

9.  **Interplanetary** Your operations frequently
    go beyond this world. You have ways of learning about major events
    on other worlds and transportation that allows you to reach other
    worlds within the star system in a reasonable amount of time. Examples:
    *Firefly*, *Flash Gordon*.

10. **Near Interstellar** You travel throughout
    the local stellar system, and frequently to nearby stars. You have
    ways of learning about major events on other worlds and transportation
    that allows you to reach other worlds in a reasonable amount of time.
    Examples: *Star Trek: Deep Space 9, Starship Troopers*

11. **Star Cluster** You adventure over many
    worlds. You may represent a federation or other group of many planets.
    You have ways of learning about major events throughout your jurisdiction
    and transportation sufficient to reach them effectively. Examples:
    *Star Trek, StarWars*, *Stainless Steel Rat*.

12. **Galactic Arm** Your adventures extend
    into most of the known worlds. Examples: *Lensmen, Perry Rhodan,
    Doctor Who*

13. **Galaxy** Your adventures extend across the entire
    Galaxy.

14. **Galactic Cluster** Your adventures
    extend across a cluster of Galaxies.

15. **Cosmic** There is no bound to the scope of your
    operations. Examples: *Star Maker*

#### Personal Scopes

1.  **Normal** A normal, if trained person. Can emerge
    victorious from a brawl\...sometimes.

2.  **Agent** An elite combatant. Can take on 10 civilians
    in a barroom brawl, several squad-cars of police, or a fire team of
    4 soldiers.

3.  **Street-level** Augmented. Can take on
    50 civilians, or a squad of 8-12 soldiers.

4.  **Neighborhood** Inhuman. Can take on 100
    civilians, or a platoon of around 25 soldiers.

5.  **City** Super-powered. Can take on an infantry
    company of 200 soldiers.

6.  **Regional** Can take on a battalion of 1000
    soldiers.

7.  **National** Can take on a division of 10,000
    soldiers.

8.  **Global** Can take on an army of 100,000 soldiers.

9.  **Interplanetary** Can take on an army
    group of 1,000,000 soldiers.

10. **Near Interstellar** Can take on an
    entire theater of war, 10,000,000 soldiers.

11. **Far Interstellar** Can take on a planet.

12. **Star Cluster** Can take on a solar system.

13. **Galactic Arm** Can take on a stellar cluster.

14. **Galaxy** Can take on an entire interstellar
    civilization.

15. **Cosmic** Can take on an entire galaxy.

### Tone {#sec:Tone}

Tone is probably the single most important decision about your campaign.
Tone is about the way the game feels, the mood and the atmosphere
of the adventures. You can and should vary the tone somewhat from
session to session, and within a session, but there will be a prevailing
mood to the game. SF adventure ranges from Flash Gordon to Firefly
to Alien, from Lost in Space through Star Trek to the rebooted Battlestar:
Galactica. This tone will actually influence game play. The lighter
the tone, the less plausible justifications for SF abilities have
to be, and the freakier coincidences can be.

Modern SF can also touch on sensitive subjects: sex, violence, and
religion. There's no right or wrong answer, but a clash of expectations
can lead to incoherence between the tone the GM is trying to set and
what actually happens, or players being out of sync with the others.
It can even lead to players finding the game unpleasant, disturbing,
or disgusting (or in the other direction, too silly, angsty or sentimental
to stomach). Make sure everybody playing is on basically the same
page, and give notice in advance if there will be possibly disturbing
elements. Disagreements over the tone of the campaign can wreck it;
when one player is aiming for goofy Saturday-morning cartoon style
with a post-apocalyptic barbarian armed with a laser sword in a world
of savagery, super-science and sorcery, and another wants to play
an ordinary crew member aboard a space-going refinery trying eke out
a living, something's got to give. Even if the players are nominally
on the same page with the style of character, the Primary Rule of
having to make sure that your actions sound like a science fiction
story places emphasis on having at least rough agreement as to what
kind of story people have in mind. If one player is trying to stick
to real-world science as much as possible while another takes his
cue from the most over-the-top Japanese anime the result won't tend
to feel like either.

One useful way to approach this is to describe your game as similar
to a source that all the players are familiar with, e.g., is it more
like Firefly, Robert Heinlein novels, Warhammer 40K, or StarWars?
That doesn't have to mean it's set in those settings, but it does
set the expectations for things like levels of violence, humor, plausibility
of physical stunts, just how cosmic or contrived are technological
devices and super-science abilities, and so forth.

#### We can rebuild him\...

Zap! has no hard-and-fast rules for characters meeting accidental
deaths in combat. This shouldn't stop you from making the game as
deadly as you and the players want it to be. Given sufficient science
fictional hand-waving, characters can be repaired by advanced medical
tech or restored from backup, be revived as cyborgs or AI simulations
in android bodies, be replaced by a clone or parallel universe twin.
Player characters should really only die permanently when the players
want them to, but that doesn't mean they don't have a lot at stake.
Lethality among minor characters is a matter of tone. Out can be narrated
as dead for minions or bystanders, or you can have even Overkilled
NPCs make it out alive.

The tone of the campaign might mean that you do brutal things to player
characters. But even in games that are maximally edgy and morbid,
players should have long-term control over their characters paths.
You should never force a player to run a character that is warped
beyond recognition from their original concept. If they are not done
having fun with the character, find a plot device to allow them to
revert back. Sometimes a PC will need to be retired and run as an
NPC, letting the player start afresh.

### Quick-and-dirty player character creation

Here's the shortest way to make up an Zap! character.

1.  Think of what kind of character you'd want to play that fits the tone
    and setting.

2.  Pick the closest match to that character in the .

3.  Keep all the numerical values of that sample character. For each descriptive
    phrase on the sample character sheet, replace it with a phrase of
    the same general category that describes the character you have in
    mind.

### Outline

If no sample character is a close match, or you want to have complete
control over character generation, you can follow these steps instead.
This is an overview, with details in subsequent sections.
*Steps:*

1.  **Decide on a Concept.** Pick a concept for your character. Captain
    of a scout ship? Xenobiologist studying alien creatures? Alien creature?
    Interstellar bounty hunter? This is the most important step, and one
    where you might want to consult the other players and the GM, so players
    are matching in tone and consistent with the setting.

2.  **Fill in a Template**. Templates in Zap! reflect the character's
    role in the game, as well as their abilities. So your concept should
    pretty much determine which template to use: crew (few amazing combat
    powers, but extraordinarily skillful and brave), bad-ass (trained
    combatant), scientist (invents new SF devices and has knowledge of
    the setting's scientific principles), unique (one-of-a-kind esper
    or alien), or any of a number of templates that the GM has designed
    for standard SF creatures in her setting.\
    \
    For example, PCs might be Captain Ace Astra (crew); Ace's best friend
    and ship's science officer Tok (scientist); Solitaire Jones, a space
    smuggler and Ace's boyfriend (bad-ass); Spotty, a genetically "uplifted"
    dog and ship's engineering officer (unique); and Tira, a shape-changing
    alien (based on an alien template the GM has created for this campaign).
    Once you've found the right Template for your concept, fill in the
    blanks in the Template with descriptions of your character's particular
    abilities (and weaknesses). There are three kinds of things needing
    descriptions at this point: Powers, Restrictions, and Shticks. Each
    template has some slots for Powers and Shticks, and some have places
    for Restrictions. Powers are abilities that can be used in or out
    of combat, Shticks are strictly non-combat abilities, and Restrictions
    are biological or technological limitations on your character. The
    Template might have some of these pre-defined, or give broad categories
    they should fall into. Others will be completely up to you to decide.
    Unless they are pre-defined by the Template, you need to to define
    what they are and how they work.\
    \
    For example, the Crew template has a "defensive power", but you
    can define this as a psychological ploy to "Keep 'em Talking"
    until help arrives, "Don't Attract Attention" where alien creatures
    ignore your presence, Luck, Athleticism, Danger sense, Invisibility,
    Force Shield, or whatever ability of that general type best suits
    your character concept. On the other hand, an Alien: Mara template
    might gives all Mara the same Shapeshift and Empathy powers. These
    do not need to be defined, the template already specifies what they
    do.\
    \
    Powers and Shticks descriptions are free-form; there is no fixed list
    of possibilities. They have numerical ratings that tell how effective
    they are when used, but it's up to you to determine what they are,
    and how and when they can be used. Restrictions are completely binding
    on your character, so they are not given numerical ratings. E.g.,
    No matter how powerful a Mara is, ultrasonics render it helpless,
    period.

3.  **Spend your Boosts.** You then have a certain number of "Boosts"
    to spend on your character, usually 3. These increase your character's
    abilities. Each Boost can be spent for one of the following:

    1.  Add one to one of the four Attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and
        Actions.

    2.  Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage. 2 Boosts
        give it a big Advantage.

    3.  Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.

    4.  Add one new Power. The starting level is given in your template.

    5.  Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one
        Shtick at one higher level.

    6.  Get a Major Asset (companion, base, vehicle, organization, or wealth).
        You can then spend additional Boosts to improve these.

    7.  Get three Minor Assets (perks, contacts, favors, rank, equipment).

4.  **Adjust Abilities (Powers and Shticks).** You can adjust your
    Abilities further by reducing the effectiveness of certain aspects
    of the Ability in order to increase its Level or take some Advantages
    on it. Every Small Disadvantage you put on the Ability gives you one
    Boost to spend on Advantages for that Power or to raise its Level;
    every Big Disadvantage gives you two Boosts. Similarly, for each Level
    you lower the Ability you get an additional Boost to spend on that
    Power. You can't trade Boosts from one Ability to spend on another.
    Modifying an Ability this way doesn't affect how many total Boosts
    you have, so doesn't change how much XP you need for a new Boost.

5.  **Pick Complications.** All protagonists have life issues that
    complicate their attempts to achieve their goals. If you're employed
    by the Space Patrol and they send you on missions, or if you suffer
    from fatigue if you spend more than two hours under normal Earth gravity
    because you were raised in space, that's a Complication. Choose Complications
    that will provide conflict for your character, or make the conflicts
    that much more interesting. Most characters pick one major and two
    minor complications; characters using the Crew template have the option
    of picking 4 minor complications instead.

6.  **Flesh out your character.** Now add colorful details that make
    your character more lifelike. There are a few mechanical decisions
    to be made here, but mostly this is you thinking through what your
    character's life is really like. For example, is your character affiliated
    with any organization or alliance of similar characters, e.g., Star
    Fleet or the Space Patrol? If so, what is their role in the organization?
    Give your character some back-story, and think about her day-to-day
    life. What causes her to brave dangers and the unknown, rather than
    holding down a safe unadventurous job? (Assuming such jobs exist in
    the campaign setting; in a post-apocalyptic world every day might
    be a struggle for survival no matter who you are.) Write down the
    basic motivation as a Drive. Think about your character's appearance.
    How does your character appear to others? What image do they project?
    Write down a short description. If you are artistic, you could even
    draw a picture of your character, or find a suitable image on the
    Internet.

### Schrödinger's Character Creation

You can actually start play with nothing but a character concept,
and defer describing abilities and assigning numbers to them until
specific abilities are needed. Pick one of the Templates or one of
the sample characters, so that you know what the numbers for various
abilities will start at. Then, each time you want to do something
that calls for a roll and that isn't covered by one of the Abilities
you've already assigned, assign an ability on the spot that covers
it, writing over one of the abilities of the Template or sample character.
If you're using a Template, don't forget you can also assign the starting
Boosts as you go if you want a number to be higher or more abilities
than just the starting ones.

Concept
-------

While there are no fixed rules for picking a character concept, there
are a few issues to think about when considering a possible character.
A good way to generate a character concept is to modify a fictional
character you enjoy. But not every character that's fun to see or
read about is fun to play. Some issues to think about are:

-   Does the character fit the tone of the game? Playing a pure comic
    relief character in a very serious game, or a melodramatic character
    in a light-hearted game, can grow old quickly.

-   Does the character have a distinctive personality? Would the other
    players be able to tell the difference between you playing this character
    and you playing other characters?

-   Does the character play well with others? Usually, you'll be playing
    as part of a team. Depending on the tone of the setting, characters
    often have dark secrets, personality flaws, and secret agendas that
    conflict with other characters. Sometimes they're just not very nice,
    to each other or to the rest of the world. But you can be a nasty
    person and still a team player. On the Firefly, characters like Jane
    or Book are often shown in conflict with the rest of the gang. But
    they still function as valuable members of the group. As long as tension
    creates interplay between the PCs, it is good. It is only when it
    blocks interaction that it's a problem. On the other hand, goody-goody
    characters that everyone likes might actually be bad for interesting
    team play. Will your character have interesting, distinctive relationships
    with the other PCs, having both friends and rivals on the team? A
    team player character contributes to group goals, but doesn't overwhelm
    everyone else's contribution. Think about typical scenes featuring
    your character. Where would others fit in? If your character is always
    alone in these scenes, always the star, or always on the sidelines,
    you might want to revise the character.

-   How does the character contribute to different kinds of group activities?
    Science Fiction will tend to have a different balance of activities
    than many other genres such as high fantasy or super-heroics. About
    equal time will usually be spent in investigation (including scientific
    research and fiddling with equipment), negotiation and interacting
    with NPCs, and combat. Try to make sure that your character has a
    role to play in all of these.

    In SF you are often up against the totally unknown. Investigation
    and research is a large part of the game, uncovering what you are
    dealing with, whether it's a being or a natural phenomenon, whether
    you must fight it, bypass it, or even incorporate it into your plans
    in order to achieve your goals and how you might do that. Zap! is
    very flexible, and you don't have to be a scientist, detective, or
    telepath to help in investigations. Maybe you know a lot of people.
    Maybe you have good transportation or unusual senses. Maybe you just
    intimidate people into divulging the key information.

    Not every being you encounter will be a foe, nor will every foe be
    defeat-able. Negotiation is about identifying and agreeing on common
    interests with beings that are suspicious of you. This is particularly
    important when dealing with representatives of larger groups, such
    as alien races or organizations. Brute force might escalate until
    the whole organization is up against your group. Again, you don't
    have to be a trained diplomat to contribute to negotiations. Maybe
    you are politically connected yourself, or maybe you can offer your
    unique services as a bargaining chip.

    Finally, combat is about kicking enemy butt. Zap!'s flexibility means
    that you can contribute to your group's combat success in a host of
    ways, not just as Mobile Infantry or with psychic powers. Your mundane
    character's attitude might make more of a difference than the bad-ass's
    big guns. If you can think of ways to combine your abilities with
    others', you can supplement their combat power. This can be as simple
    as distracting a foe while they attack. You can also help by assisting
    teammates to recover from attacks.

-   How well can you portray this character? Sometimes a character that
    you love to watch isn't a character that you want to play. If it's
    important that your character is alien, can you give it alien beliefs
    and desires, at least from time to time so that it's more than just
    a human with a bumpy forehead? Can you be as nasty as your PC, or
    are you a softy at heart? Do you really want to brood all the time,
    or do you burst if you can't crack wise?

Filling In The Templates
------------------------

### The Templates

All Templates start with 3 Boosts to spend, plus any Bonus Boosts.
Bonus Boosts don't count towards the character's starting Boosts when
it comes to calculating XP necessary to earn a new Boost.

**Crew** Crew have no super-science or psychic abilities or specialized
combat training, just courage, skill, and subtlety. They are often
the main focus of SF settings, sitting in the command chair, exploring
new worlds, and generally running the show.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Defense Power**: One "defense" power @ 6. Active or automatic
(choose one). Examples: Keep 'em Talking, Force Shield, Great Reflexes.

**Combat Skill**: One power @ 4

**Shticks**: 6 Shticks @ 5

**New Powers** begin @ 4 **New Shticks** begin @ 5

**Bad-ass** The Bad-ass might have innate super science or psychic
abilities, a signature piece of equipment like powered armor, or just
specialized training and weapons that can threaten even powerful alien
menaces.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 3, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Powers**: Three powers @ 5. Typically, an offensive skill or
weapon, a defensive skill or device, and some other power such as
a movement power.

**Shticks**: 4 Shticks @ 4

**Bonus Boost**: You have one extra Boost to spend. This does
not add to your base number of Boosts (for experience purposes).

**New powers** begin @ 5 **New Shticks** begin @ 4

**Scientist** You are trained in the science of the setting,
including the principles of super science that go beyond what is currently
known. While there is little you absolutely cannot do in extending
and applying the known science of the setting, you are at your strongest
when you combine your scientific abilities with specific knowledge
of the problems you are attempting to solve.

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 3, Actions: 2

**Science! power**: Choose one of three possibilities:

-   Science! power @ 5 (d6, d4), (AA) Ultra-flexible, (A) Power-up to
    7 (d8, d6) with 3 research successes (self or others);

-   Science! power @ 6 (d6, d6), (A) Flexible, (A) Power-up to 7 (d8,
    d6), and Ultra-flexible with 3 research scenes.

-   Science! power @ 7 (d8, d6), (A) Power-up to Ultra-flexible with 3
    research scenes.

For all choices, you get the Power-up by announcing that you are researching
a device for a specific circumstances.

**Gadget defense**: A scientific gadget defense power @ 4. (A)
Flexible. Choose whether Active or Automatic.

**Shticks**: Choose 2 Shticks @ 4, plus Scientific Research @
5.

**Restriction**: Pick a Restriction that is tied in with your
brand of Science! Do you need DNA samples to analyze? Are you a roboticist,
with not even rudimentary knowledge of biology? Must you do all your
research in your own lab with its specialized equipment? You should
design your restriction so that it gives your approach to Science
a unique flavor, and makes it seem less like a magical power where
anything is possible.

**New Powers** begin @ 5 **New Shticks** begin @ 4

**Unique** You are one of a rare kind of being, possibly alien
or robotic. Perhaps you are the only one. Perhaps you are a version
of a standard creature, but somehow made unique by a freak event,
such as an alien raised by humans and with a thoroughly human outlook
on life despite looking vastly different or having bizarre powers,
or a robot who unlike others of its kind has become sentient or has
been freed from the Three Laws of Robotics (if those are a feature
of the setting).

:    

**Attributes**: Toughness: 2, Stamina: 2, Will: 2, Actions: 2

**Powers**: 2 powers @ 6 (d6,d6).

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4, d2).

**Bonus Boosts**: Add three bonus Boosts. These do not add to
base Boosts for the purpose of experience.

**Restriction**: Pick any restriction.

**New Powers** begin @ 6 **New Shticks** begin @ 3

### Aliens in Zap!

There are several different approaches you could take to playing an
alien character in Zap! You could make your alien race a Shtick or
a Power, use the Unique Template, or use an entirely new Template
specific to that alien race in the setting. Which approach you use
depends on how much your character concept focuses on being a representative
member of that alien race vs. it being background flavor while other
aspects of your character such as chosen profession take center stage.
Two players might both be members of the same alien race and take
different approaches to designing their characters depending on what
they want to emphasize. One might choose to be the ship's security
officer, choosing the Bad-ass Template and making his membership in
his proud warrior race, the Klangons, just one of his four Shticks;
the other might make his alien status central to his character concept
by using the Klangon Template devised by the GM and relegating his
status as captain of the ship's marines to one of that Template's
slots for Shticks.

Here's an alien character template. Other examples of templates for
typical SF creatures are found in Section [8](#alientemplates){reference-type="ref" reference="alientemplates"}.
Before using an SF creature template ask your GM if that creature
is allowed as a PC and whether the GM has altered the template for
her setting. The GM may also have created new SF creature templates
for the setting, so ask about other possibilities. (The rules for
creating new templates are in the section on ,
in Part III.)\

**Alien Template**

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**: 3 Powers **@** 6 (d6, d6) If suitable, you can
add Advantages and Disadvantages to each power. Each small advantage
decreases the level 1, big by 2, small Disadvantages increase it 1,
big Disadvantages increase by 2.

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)
if they fit the stereotype

**New Powers:** Start at 6 if they fit the stereotype, 4 otherwise.
For example, Mind Meld be an optional Space-Elf power. It won't be
part of the starting template, but if the player adds it, it starts
at 6 rather than 4.

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise

**Restrictions**: Any number of restrictions. Pool similar or
minor restrictions together.

**Power Boosts**: For each restriction, add one power @ 6 to
the template, increase one attribute 1, or increase one power by 1.

### Describing Abilities {#sec:DescribingPowers}

Once you've picked a Template, you fill
out the Template with specific Abilities (Powers and Shticks) according
to your concept. You give each ability slot in the template a name,
and a brief description. Although they don't change the mechanics
of using the abilities this free-form description really determines
what the ability is. Throughout the game you'll be able to use the
ability precisely when the game situation matches the description.
While some abilities might seem more limited than others, the challenge
is to provide creative justifications for the ability being useful.
So, for example, if your power is Strength it cannot be used directly
at a distance. This doesn't need to be spelled out or compensated
for; it's implicit in the notion of physical strength. But that doesn't
mean that you can never use the power in a ranged attack, just that
you need to use it indirectly. You can say you are using your Strength
to pick up a large object and hurl it at your foe, or to cause the
building they are in to collapse by knocking away a support beam,
or to intimidate them by a display of violence. In any of these ways
you use your Strength you resolve your degree of success using the
same mechanics and the same dice. Your free-form descriptions tell
you when and how you can use your abilities. Then the mechanics indicate
whether you succeed and by how much.

#### Powers vs. Shticks

Abilities come in two forms: Powers and Shticks. Anything that can
be used to attack and defend in combat is a Power, even if it may
have other uses. Anything that can't typically be used to hurt somebody
or defend yourself against being hurt is a Shtick. The same sort of
Ability might be a Power for one character and a Shtick for another,
depending on how the player sees themselves using the Ability in the
game.

While the name Powers suggests superhuman abilities, in Zap! Powers
are a generic term for *any* kind of Ability that can be used
to attack or defend against attacks. So training with a gun is a Power,
as is the Ability to lie convincingly, since it can be used to prevent
an enemy from attacking you. On the other hand, maybe your Ability
to empathically "discern lies" is a Shtick, rather than a Power,
since it would almost never be used to attack or defend in combat.
Even something like Computer Programming, which would normally be
a Shtick that takes minutes or hours to use effectively could be a
Power if you envision it being fast and effective enough to, say,
seize control of robots as they're attacking you and have them fight
on your side instead. Note that sometimes the Primary Rule would imply
that a Shtick could be used to defend yourself. E.g. if a creature
had a Power to create illusions that it uses to lure people into danger,
an Ability to "Empathically Discern Lies" would be a plausible
defense, even if it had been characterized as a Shtick.

Powers can also be used outside of combat. For example, you could
have "Keen Sense of Smell" as a Power or a Shtick. Either way,
you could use the Ability to sniff out drugs in a locker or track
someone through the woods, but you can only use it directly to give
you a defense against an invisible attacker if it is a Power.

#### Customizing Abilities

You can customize your abilities with ,
however the main thing that makes your abilities unique is the free-form
description, and you don't need to spell out the consequences in terms
of any mechanics. If your Power is Flame Blast, then it goes without
saying that this power doesn't work in water or in a vacuum, and it
might be dangerous to use in a zeppelin. On the other hand, it also
goes without saying that you can also use the Power to light up a
dark room or to provide warmth if the party is caught in a blizzard.

If you described your Power as Psychic Flames instead of physical
flames, and specify that it creates an illusion in enemies minds that
convinces them they're burning, then although it will usually work
just like a Flame Blast, there's no reason it shouldn't work under
water. You likely won't be able to light things on fire with it, or
light up a room, but physical armor would probably provide no defense.
All of these advantages and disadvantages are implicit in the description,
and do not need to be "bought."

If a Power has an especially wide range of applications, particularly
if you can use it not only as an attack and defense, but also to move
things around, manipulate them, influence their actions and so forth
you should take the FlexibleAdvantage
on the Power. If the Power is so versatile that it's easier to list
what you cannot use it for than what you can, such as for something
like Psionics, then the Ultra-Flexible Advantage
applies.

In addition there are two mechanical variations on Powers that are
neither Advantages or Disadvantages: Movement Powers and Automatic
Powers.

#### Movement powers

Movement Powers primarily let you move around. They may also be used
to attack or defend when that makes sense, e.g., using fly to ram
into a foe, or super speed to dodge bullets. Movement Powers do not
take an Action to use if they are used for movement; if you use them
for anything else they take an Action and only get to roll one die
(the larger die). Like any other power, you cannot use it more than
once a round, so you cannot use a Movement power both to move and
attack or defend. Without a Movement power you can still move in combat,
but it will take an Action to move any significant distance, and you'll
be at a disadvantage if you're trying to move while anything else
is interfering with it, such as infected mutants grabbing at your
ankles or the heaving of the ship's deck making it difficult to walk.

#### Automatic powers

Automatic powers are used in response to a certain kind of action.
They can be used multiple times in a round, and do not require an
Action to use. On the other hand, they
cannot normally be used at will, unless you can force the trigger
condition to be met. What those conditions are and what the Power
does (whether it's an attack, a defense, or movement) should be clear
from the description. An Automatic Power must be either for Attack
or Defense, not both, and to
have an attack be automatic is an Advantage. For instance, Armor could
be an automatic Defense that would be used whenever you were physically
attacked. Flame Body could be automatic Attack that would be used
whenever you were grabbed. Automatic Defenses defend against every
appropriate incoming attack, automatic Offenses attack everyone who
meets the proper conditions. If using a Power triggers an Automatic
Power, the Automatic Power Combines
with the first Power, giving it a +1. For example, if you use your
Super-Strength to grab someone, your Flame Body automatic attack would
always combine with it. You roll the dice for Super-Strength, but
add 1 to the result for the Flame Body. If you use Super-Strength
to throw something at someone, Flame Body wouldn't apply, so you would
get no bonus. Automatic Defenses cannot be hindered or disabled unless
they have the Can Be Hindered Disadvantage.

#### What Counts as a Power?

There are often several possible ways to divide your abilities up
into powers. If you can psionically cause people to sleep, find you
persuasive, or become confused, do you want these to be three separate
powers or one power called Telempathy? If you have a suit of Powered
Armor that increases your strength, provides you protection and life
support, and has mini-missiles one the shoulders and a blaster built
into the chest, you could have one Power "Powered Armor" or five
separate Powers your armor gives you. The difference is that with
the first option you could use at most one of your armor's powers
each round, but with the second you could potentially use your armor
in five different ways each round (if you have enough Actions).

You do not need to purchase Powers that are for "color" rather
than for combat advantage. Your character can turn televisions or
lights on and off with a glance without a special power. Only buy
it as a Power instead of a Shtick if you plan to be able to use it
to harm or defend against a foe, possibly by distracting them (e.g.
"Keep 'Em Talking" is a perfectly viable automatic defense, though
the Primary Rule would imply it could only be used against things
that understand your language). If the Power you have in mind isn't
actually directly useful in combat, it is probably better to treat
it as color and not list it as a power. For example, a werewolf can
change into a wolf, but what makes that useful is that the wolf form
has claws and fangs, a superior sense of smell, and regenerates. On
the other hand, you cannot go through life as a wolf, because it's
hard to turn doorknobs. So you don't have to list "Shift into wolf
form" as a power; instead, "Only usable in wolf form" would
be minor Disadvantages on some of your
powers, such as "Claws and Fangs".

It is assumed that given enough time and resources, without distractions
or opposition, a Scientist can do pretty much anything the setting's
science will allow. If you are not a scientist, you know one you can
bribe, beguile, seduce, or intimidate. So you can accomplish all kinds
of stuff in downtime without needing a separate power listed on your
sheet. If the setting's technology allows you to regrow somebody's
full body as long as you save the head, you don't have to list that
as a Power, you just have to justify how you manage to get access
to the appropriate facilities to repair your injured companions. Just
make sure your descriptions of your downtime activities are consistent
with your character concept. Your downtime activities will also be
fodder for GM plots, so abuse of this rule will often backfire on
you.

#### What Counts as a Shtick?

Anything that cannot plausibly be used on its own for attacking or
defending is a Shtick. Many Shticks are used to do research and gather
information, to operate and repair equipment, to influence other characters
in social situations, or to enhance Powers in combat.

Note that Shticks can be used in Combination with Powers to attack
or defend, as long as it makes sense according to the Primary Rule,
e.g. you can Combine your "Keen Sense of Smell" Shtick with your
"Catlike Reflexes" Power to give yourself a better chance against
an invisible attacker.

Under unusual circumstances the Primary Rule may dictate that a Shtick
actually be used directly to attack or defend; usually this is the
result of the target having a Restriction or Complication that makes
this possible. If a creature has the Restriction "Ultra-sensitive
hearing, can be hurt by high pitched noises" then a Shtick such
as Opera Singer could be used as an attack by describing how you sing
an E above high C.

### Mechanics for Abilities

Each power has a numerical rating, which determines two dice to roll
when using your Ability. Sometimes there is also a fixed number to
add in to one or both dice. When you use your Ability, you roll both
kinds of dice, and add in the modifier if any. You take the higher
of the two as your result. If the Ability is opposing another character's
Ability, they do the same, and the bigger value is the one who succeeds;
the difference determines how big the success was. If someone succeeds
on an attack against you, you are usually Hindered. That means that
you only roll the larger die when you use a power, until you or someone
else takes an action to free you from the hindering effect. The table
describes what dice correspond to what power levels.

You only roll an uncontested Ability if it is not absolutely clear
that you could use the Ability for that purpose, or if you have reason
to care whether it takes several tries or extra time and effort to
succeed; if you have all the time in the world, just assume that you
would get the maximum that you could roll on the dice and go from
there.

Roll the two dice listed and take the higher result. In Zap! you
never add the dice together.

   **PL**  Dice         **PL**  Dice
  -------- ----------- -------- ----------------
   **2**   1 point      **13**  d8+5, d12
   **3**   single d4    **14**  d8+5, d8+5
   **4**   d4, d4       **15**  d10+5, d8+5
   **5**                **16**  d10+5, d10+5
   **6**   d6, d6       **17**  d12+5, d10+5
   **7**   d8, d6       **18**  d12+5, d12+5
   **8**   d8, d8       **19**  d8+10, d12+5
   **9**   d10, d8      **20**  d8+10, d8+10
   **10**  d10, d10     **21**  d10+10, d8+10
   **11**  d12, d10     **22**  d10+10, d10+10
   **12**  d12, d12     **23**  d12+10, d10+10

Note that the Power Levels follow an easy to remember
pattern up to 12. At even levels you use two dice of the same size,
and that size matches the level (Power Level 4 is d4, d4; Power Level
6 is d6, d6; Power Level 8 is d8, d8\...). Odd levels have one die
of the next higher level and one of the next lower (Power Level 5
is a d6 and a d4, Power Level 7 is a d8 and a d6, Power Level 9 is
a d10 and a d8\...). It gets a tiny bit trickier once you get past
d12: past d12 the dice go d8+5, d10+5, d12+5, d8+10, d10+10, and so
on. However, since at any given Scope the Powers and Shticks begin
at around PL 4-6, it will be quite a while before that becomes an
issue.

### Research[\[sec:Research\]]{#sec:Research label="sec:Research"}

The Scientist's Science! Power is slightly special,
in that it starts off as a slightly weaker power and can be upgraded
during the course of an adventure by doing Research into the nature
of whatever the PCs are facing in order to tailor the power specifically
to what's currently necessary. There are three variations:

-   Starting with an Ultra-Flexible power that can do most anything but
    is at low level and can Power Up through Research to a higher level;

-   Starting with a high level Power that has one specific use and can
    Power Up to Ultra-Flexible;

-   Starting with medium power and flexibility that can Power Up to full
    power and Ultra-Flexible.

In all three variations, the procedure for doing Research remains
the same: you must, over the course of the adventure, engage in **three**
separate scenes that revolve around your character and your allies
doing the necessary Research into the device or scientific principle
you're trying to create, using your Research Shtick. In most cases
the Research Shtick
should work without a roll. If a roll
is required because the player is unsure whether their type of science
really can accomplish what they're aiming to do (say a neuroscientist
whose powers operate on brains is trying to research a device to deactivate
a robot), the GM should assign a difficulty based on the power level
of the target; if the roll fails, the Scientist can't try again in
that scene, and will have to come up with some other approach to moving
the research forward or a different sort of device.

For instance, you might have a scene where you and possibly your allies
are using the ship's computer records to identify the creature attacking
the colonists; a scene where you go to the mine where the colonists
were attacked to recover alien tissues that the device requires; and
a scene where you use the ship's lab and that tissue to create a device
capable of paralyzing the creature. The exact nature of the scenes
should be determined during play, through the players and GM deciding
what's plausible given what's been going on so far, rather than a
cookie-cutter approach: computer library, tissue, lab. It's justifying
what your character is doing as an occasion to employ the Research
Shtick; the requirement that there be three such scenes and that the
scenes be different is just to prevent every adventure from turning
into a wait while the Scientist character hangs around in the ship's
lab until the device is ready.

When you perform three successful scenes in which you are doing research
(scenes where the focus is research and you score a success with your
Research Shtick if necessary), your device is ready, and you announce
what it does. It should be one very specific effect, such as "Shrink
giant insects" or "paralyze methane-breathing creatures." While
you should be researching during this time, that doesn't mean you
can't participate in scenes. You can put down your tools and zap the
creature attacking you in the lab, or go out to the scene of the crime
and collect scientific samples.

If you decide a roll ought to be required other PCs can assist you
by using their investigative abilities to perform relevant research.
The difficulty is set to be the base power level of the intended target.

### Advantages And Disadvantages {#sec:AdvantagesAndDisadvantages}

Advantages are aspects that make a Ability more useful, and Disadvantages
are things that makes it less useful. For instance if a Ability is
exceptionally Flexible so that almost anything can be justified according
to the Primary Rule, that's an Advantage; if a Ability has a more
limited use than normal, for instance it can only be used to defend
against cold-based attacks, that's a Disadvantage. There are both
Big and Small Advantages and Disadvantages (labeled AA and A, or DD
and D), and their effects on a Ability are cumulative. A Small Advantage
on a Ability costs one Boost, a Big Advantage costs 2, a Small Disadvantage
gives you an extra Boost to spend on that Ability, and a Big Disadvantage
gives you two extra Boosts on that Ability (you may not take a Disadvantage
on a Ability in order to get Boosts to spend on some other Ability
or Attribute).

### Advantages: {#sec:Advantages}

Advantages represent some quality of the Ability that makes it more
useful. You should only give the Ability an advantage if it represents
a significant increase in the Ability. Many little side effects that
might be advantageous under some circumstances are already covered
by the description. For instance, if you have a Sleep Gas Ability
it isn't necessary to take Exotic even though it's implied that something
like a Shield or Tough Hide wouldn't be useful as a defense. Other
fairly common Abilities like Life Support or Immunity to Poison would
clearly stop the Ability altogether, while still others would depend
on how they were described as being used (e.g., using Reflexes to
jump out of the way, or Control Wind to blow it away) and so would
get to roll for defense. Exotic would be required for something like
Psionic Assault, or Time stop, since it's quite difficult to reason
through whether it's at all plausible for Reflexes or Magic Shield
to interfere. Note that this depends largely on how you choose to
define the Ability: if you define it so that Psionic Assault would
have to roll against so simple a thing as dodging with Reflexes or
Acrobatics, or be completely negated by Armor or Rocky Hide, then
you wouldn't need to justify it with the Exotic Advantage. (AA) indicates
a Big Advantage; (A) a Small Advantage.

Area Effect (AA)

:   The Ability affects all targets (friend or
    foe) in an area at full power, without needing to split it. Number
    of targets at the same Scope affected is the result on the lower die,
    times two for each Scope level lower.

Area Effect, lesser (A)

:   The Ability affects one chosen target
    at full power, and some additional nearby targets (friend or foe)
    at reduced power (result of the lower die). Number affected is the
    result of the lower die.

Bare Handed (A)

:   The Ability doesn't require any equipment as
    part of its narration; it gets both dice regardless.

Control (AA)

:   a Knock Out with this Power will allow you to control
    the actions of the target until the Knock Out is broken, at the cost
    of 1 Action per Round. Merely Hindering
    the target with a Control Power will let you force the target to take
    a single Action in the target's Turn; this will use one of the target's
    Actions and one of the target's Abilities (if required) before the
    target regains control; if the target is Hindered by some previous
    attack, he or she will not break free of the Hindrance first unless
    that's the command, instead the Action commanded will be taken while
    still Hindered.

Delayed (A)

:   the effect of the Ability doesn't occur until either
    a specified event or a certain amount of time has elapsed. You could
    use this Advantage to create a bomb, or set a trip-wire, or use a
    Power with the Control Advantage to give somebody a post-hypnotic
    suggestion (though in the latter case you would need the Subtle Advantage
    as well or the target would know about it).

Exotic[ ]{.medium}(AA)

:   An Exotic attack can't be defended against
    by ordinary Abilities, so targets use the Default Skill instead. E.g.,
    A mystic curse or psychic bolt can't be usually be stopped by armor
    or a force-field. Exotic attacks must define a fairly broad class
    of circumstances that automatically negate them (e.g., any magical
    defense, any unusual metabolism, Abilities being based on technology,
    being a non-magical creature, etc). In addition, Defenses which are
    Flexible or Ultra-Flexible should get their normal roll unless there's
    clearly no way they could help. Things like poison gas or blinding
    flashes of light are not Exotic, in and of themselves, because ordinary
    Powers or even Shticks (such as having Life Support built into your
    suit, or Lightning Reflexes to close your eyes) could justify a defense
    roll if they don't negate the Power completely. You may have only
    one Exotic Power, unless all your Exotic Powers are negated by the
    same circumstances.

Flexible (A)

:   The Ability can justify a wide range of effects
    (e.g., electromagnetic powers). Whether a Ability should be counted
    as Flexible or not is up to the player; generally a Power that's mostly
    used for attacking or defending, with occasional use for extra things
    that directly follow from its nature (such as a lightning bolt short-circuiting
    electronics) doesn't need the Flexible Advantage even if it can take
    many forms, such as a lightning bolt, a ball of lightning, grabbing
    someone to shock them, and so on; a Ability that's intended to be
    used to do many things beside simple attack and defense, such as picking
    up objects, holding things, fencing them off, gathering or concealing
    information, and the like should be given the Flexible Advantage.

Larger Scope (AA)

:   The Ability operates one Scope higher than
    normal; this doesn't change the Power Level, even when used versus
    targets at the normal Scope, it merely changes the interpretation
    of the Ability in terms of things like weight, speed, area, range,
    etc.

Ultra-Flexible (AA)

:   The Ability can justify almost any effect
    (e.g., Sorcery); you must still choose some things that are beyond
    its capabilities. Ultra-Flexible is like Flexible, but with even more
    applications. Where a Flexible Power might be one that can pick up
    or push things in addition to attack and defense, or can create an
    illusion in addition to attack and defense, an Ultra-Flexible Power
    is one that could do all those and more. A typical Ultra-Flexible
    Power is one where it is harder to think of things that it shouldn't
    be permitted to do rather than things that it should.

Persistent (AA)

:   The Ability will remain in effect as long as
    you spend your entire turn maintaining it, and no external force interferes.

Power-up (A)

:   The power level can be increased, under some circumstances,
    or at a cost or risk. Pick a Large Disadvantage, and a way of spending
    two Boosts on the Ability (e.g., +2 power level, one Large Advantage,
    2 Small Advantages, or +1 level and a Small Advantage) The Ability
    can be used at the higher level if the character takes the Disadvantage
    for that use. If the Disadvantage affects future uses of the Ability,
    e..g, Burnout, it affects the entire Ability, not just the power-up.
    It must be a Disadvantage that makes sense for a single use.

Subtle (A)

:   It's not obvious that the Ability is being used,
    unless you have a Ability that grants you appropriate senses. Telepathy
    or Mind Control are typical Abilities that benefit from this Advantage,
    but it could apply to something more prosaic, like an invisible Sleep
    gas.

### Disadvantages: {#sec:Disadvantages}

Disadvantages represent some Disadvantage that makes the Ability less
useful than the Primary Rule would otherwise allow. It is not intended
that you place Disadvantages on Abilities merely to represent the
Disadvantages that such a Ability would naturally have given the Primary
Rule. For instance, even though fire requires oxygen and can only
burn flammable materials, you wouldn't take Circumstanced Limited
to represent it not working without oxygen, or not harming things
that aren't flammable unless the intent was to make it even more vulnerable
to those circumstances than you would assume such as requiring high
concentrations of oxygen as from a tank of compressed oxygen, or only
capable of damaging things at all if they are as easily combustible
as, say, paper.

(DD) indicates a Big Disadvantage; (D) is a Small Disadvantage.

Absorption (D)

:   The Ability must be used as a defense each time
    before it can be used for any other purposes; in other words you must
    use it to absorb an incoming attack in order to "Power it up."

Automatic Can Be Hindered (DD)

:   automatic defenses are normally
    not affected by Hindering
    or Disabling, but this Power is. Reduce it to one die when you are
    Hindered.

Burn Out (DD)

:   If you roll doubles the Ability works this time
    but burns out and can't be used again; restoring the Ability can only
    be done by application of some suitable other Ability or being out
    of combat for three Turns (e.g., by using Gadgeteering to fix Powered
    Armor, or by returning to your base to repair it). If the Ability
    is reduced to a single die for some reason, such as being Hindered,
    roll that single die for the result, then roll the second die to see
    if it burns out.

Combination Difficult (D)

:   Cannot be combined with your own
    Abilities.

Combination Impossible (DD)

:   Cannot be combined with any other
    Abilities.

Delayed (D)

:   The Ability goes off one turn after the Action is
    spent.

Disabling Only (DD)

:   The Power can only be used to Disable other
    Powers (e.g., a Power that drained mutant powers).

Easily Disabled (D)

:   The Ability is easy to disable; when targeted,
    it defends itself with only one die. Captain Patriot's shield is easier
    to take away or interfere with than the Living Flame's Fire Blasts,
    so he takes it as Easily Disabled.

Equipment Required (D)

:   The Ability cannot operate without equipment,
    e.g. Wormhole Navigation, assuming you need a computer to do the calculations.

Automatic Can be Disabled (D)

:   automatic defenses normally
    are only reduced to a single die when Disabled (how do you render
    somebody's rocky skin completely ineffective?), but this Power can
    be interfered with as if it were a Regular Power instead; e.g., if
    Captain Patriot took his Shield as a automatic Defense (so he can
    use it to defend without having to spend an Action), ordinarily attackers
    couldn't totally Disable it at all. Since that doesn't make complete
    sense (if they physically take it away, how would he still defend
    with it?) he takes as automatic Can be Disabled meaning when somebody
    can Disable it as if it were a Regular Power. automatics that Can
    Be Disabled still roll both dice to resist.

Erratic (D)

:   The Ability does nothing when you roll a Mishap.

Fragile (D)

:   The Ability is hard to repair once disabled; when
    an attempt is made to disable it, a Hinder
    counts as Out, and Out means that the Ability can't be repaired without
    spending hours outside of combat, possibly at a base or lab with special
    tools.

Ultra-Fragile (DD)

:   The Ability is so hard to repair once disabled
    that when an attempt is made to disable it, a Hinder
    counts as the Ability being unable to be repaired without spending
    hours outside of combat, and Out means the Ability can't be repaired
    except by going on an adventure to restore it, or spending 1 XP.

Limited (D)

:   The Ability can only be used when certain conditions
    are met, which should occur about half the time or when you can't
    control the circumstances. E.g., a Ability that only works when you
    have both hands free, or a automatic Defense that only works against
    impact attacks (being punched, hit with flying buildings, and so on,
    but not lasers, fire, and the like).

Very Limited (DD)

:   The Ability can only be used when certain
    rare conditions are met, which should occur during the occasional
    adventure and not under your control. E.g., Ability only works under
    water in a campaign set on dry land, Ability only works during a full
    moon, or a automatic Defense that only works against cold-based attacks.

Shots (D)

:   The Ability has a fixed amount of "shots" that
    gets expended; number of uses can be up to 8. The hero must take active
    steps, such as returning to base, in order to replenish it.

Side Effects (D or DD)

:   Instead of doing nothing when you
    roll a Mishap, something bad happens, such as hitting an ally, or
    yourself. The GM decides the exact effect when the roll occurs. The
    small version does something strange, but probably not dangerous.

Single-Action Defense (D)

:   when used as an active defense only
    defends against a single attack, rather than throughout the round
    as normal.

Single Use (DD)

:   The Ability can only be used once per combat.
    Replenishes automatically between combats (at least three consecutive
    Turns while not using any Actions).

Slow (D)

:   The Ability takes 2 Actions to use.

Ultra-Slow (DD)

:   The Ability takes 3 Actions to use. 

Unpredictable (DD)

:   The effect of the Ability is up to the GM,
    not the player (though it still must be beneficial).

**A Note On Flexibility** [\[sec:ANoteOnFlexibility\]]{#sec:ANoteOnFlexibility label="sec:ANoteOnFlexibility"}

Unlike some of the other Advantages, Flexible and Ultra-Flexible advantages
aren't very sharply defined. Even having a Power that represented
a variety of equivalent attacks that differ in such minor things as
whether they're melee or ranged or the exact flavor of damage, such
as being armed with a sword and a bow, or having a suit that has wrist-blasters,
laser eye-beams, and a chest cannon doesn't really make the Power
much more Flexible as long as conceptually the powers do the same
sorts of things, such as damage targets.

It's when the Ability can be either be altered on the fly or has a
number of completely distinct uses so that it can take advantage of
the Primary Rule to do a wide variety of different things that it
becomes an issue. For instance, since a sword and a gun would in general
both be straightforward attacks (kinetic energy, even) there's no
need to apply the Flexible Advantage to a Power that represents having
both. On the other hand, if your Power is a gun that can switch between
firing a laser and lifting things via gravitational force or generating
illusions of scary monsters, that probably should be given the Flexible
Advantage to make up for being able to use the Power in an especially
wide set of circumstances. Similarly if your Ability is a utility
belt that contains a bunch of different things such as handcuffs,
lock-picks, listening devices, a cutting torch, and a flash-bang grenade,
that would be represented by the Flexible Advantage.

Generally with the Flexible Advantage you should be able to define
what it does in advance, and should limit yourself to no more than
the Ability Level in different aspects at once, so the aforementioned
Utility Belt with five tricks would require PL 5. That doesn't preclude
using the Primary Rule to come up with new clever uses for, say, handcuffs,
but it should preclude suddenly discovering a new device that's just
what you need for the situation in there. If it makes sense, you are
free to change the list of what your Flexible Ability does (e.g. what
tricks you are carrying in your utility belt) between adventures,
or if you return to your base.

Ultra-Flexible Abilities, on the other hand, represent those that
have uses too numerous to list out in advance, or that can be reconfigured
"on the fly" by the hero. With a utility belt using the Ultra-Flexible
advantage, you are allowed to just "discover" that you've packed
away a can of aerosol shark-repellant for just this occasion, or (in
a more serious vein) that you have the chemicals needed to whip something
like that up on a moment's notice. With Ultra-Flexible Abilities you
should be scrupulous in defining in advance categories of things that
the Ability *cannot* do. Generally the Ultra-Flexible Ability
should have either one small restriction per PL above 6 (such as can't
affect targets with a completely inhuman metabolism) or half that
many large restrictions (such as can't affect inanimate objects, or
targets with no mind). More powerful Ultra-Flexible Abilities thus
are more restricted, but they're much more dangerous because they
can be tailored to the immediate situation.

Flexibility should *not* be used just to have a bunch of different
attacks to tailor them to bypass the target's defenses; if you wish
to have a Power that is particularly hard to defend against, take
the Exotic advantage instead, or in addition. Flexibility is meant
to give you more options in how you describe using your Power and
the tasks it can apply to, not just a straight mechanical advantage
in knocking foes out.

In any event, Flexibility has no bearing on whether a Power goes against
Toughness, Stamina, or Will: that is determined by the Primary Rule
description of how the Power is being used. A Laser Gun might be an
attack against Toughness if fired directly against a foe, against
Stamina if it were used to rupture a nearby coolant line to release
a choking cloud of gas, or even against Will if you were snapping
off shots trying to force the foes to keep under cover.

Whether to represent several different things that you can do as a
single Power with the Flexible Advantage or take several different
Powers is a matter of style. Since you can only use a Power once per
Round, if you envision using it two different ways in the same Round,
or it seems implausible to you that using say, your powered armor's
chest beam should preclude you using its life-support at the same
time, you should take the powers separately.

#### New Advantages and Disadvantages {#sec:NewAdvantagesAndDisadvantages}

The list of Advantages
and Disadvantages is not exhaustive, and you can consult with the
GM and other players about new ones you'd like to add. Before you
do, though, you should consider whether it can be handled by one of
the existing ones, some of which are quite broad, or by a Complication,
or just by applying the Primary Rule given how you imagine the Power
working. Zap! discourages min-maxing (tweaking characters to get
the maximum effectiveness for the minimum drawbacks), so before you
add a new Advantage or Disadvantage you should really consider whether
it's necessary to capture the concept of the Power and not just an
excuse to be able afford an extra Power or Advantage or to make the
Power useful out of all proportion to its Power Level. One quick test
is if you wouldn't mind if the enemies start employing the same Advantage
or Disadvantage on their Powers, it's probably okay.

### Mishaps[\[sec:Mishaps\]]{#sec:Mishaps label="sec:Mishaps"}

Some Disadvantages such as Erratic or Side-Effects only trigger when
the hero rolls a "Mishap" on an attempt to use the power. Mishaps
never occur outside the context of these Disadvantages, so most of
the time you don't have to consider it. Mishaps don't occur if the
use of the power doesn't require a roll, unless the hero has the Frequent
Mishaps Disadvantage.

If the power has such a Disadvantage then if a roll on the power comes
up **doubles**, there is a chance of a Mishap. Roll a d12 to
"confirm" whether there's a Mishap: if you roll less than or equal
to the die-size of the highest die, then a Mishap has occurred and
the Disadvantage takes effect. E.g. a PL 7 (d6, d4) power has Burn-Out
as a Disadvantage: the player rolls 3, 3 which means there's a chance
of a Mishap. She rolls a d12, and if she gets a 6 or less the power
burns out. Disadvantages that have a chance of Mishap will occur 1/12
of the time (powers rolling bigger dice have less chance of doubles,
but more chance that doubles are confirmed as a Mishap).

If a Power that can have a Mishap has been reduced to a single die,
such as when you are Hindered, instead of checking for doubles roll
a d12. On a roll of 12 a Mishap occurs.

####### Alternate Method

If players find it simpler they can roll a separate d12 Mishap die
whenever they roll a power with such a Disadvantage, and the Mishap
occurs on a roll of 12, regardless of what the other dice show. The
odds of Mishap are the same, but it requires rolling more dice since
you roll the Mishap die every time and not just when doubles come
up.

### Restrictions

Scientists and Uniques need to choose a Restriction. A fixed set of
Restrictions will be part of the templates for most alien creatures.
Restrictions should be severe enough that they could be used to definite
strategic advantage by a foe that knows about you, while not crippling
your character for play. Below are several kinds of restriction for
inspiration; this is not meant as a complete list, but suggests how
severe restrictions ought to be. You can group minor restrictions
together, especially of the same kind, to make a more serious restriction.

Addiction:

:   You need a certain unusual substance or activity to
    survive, or are compelled to seek it. If you are deprived of this
    substance, you can be distracted by its presence. This counts as being
    hindered until you obtain it or it is removed from your presence.

Alter Ego:

:   Under some circumstances, your body is taken over
    by a personality that doesn't take your wishes into account. For example,
    a human host of an alien symbiont might generally be the dominant
    personality but sometimes find the alien in control.

Aversion:

:   You find a common substance unpleasant to be around,
    e.g., a desert-world alien that hates water. You will avoid it if
    at all possible, and if suddenly presented with it, will cringe away.
    This usually takes one Action. You cannot usually be affected multiple
    times.

Block:

:   There is a common activity that you cannot do. For example,
    a cyborg might be unable to swim.

Compulsion:

:   Under some circumstance, you must do something whether
    you wish to or not. You lose control of your actions until this is
    finished. For example, a shapeshifting alien might be required to
    spend one hour out of 24 in a liquid state, unable to take any actions.

Ritual:

:   You need to undertake a daily ritual to keep your powers
    or stay healthy. If you don't get the chance to perform the ritual,
    your powers are hindered or disabled until you can do it. For instance,
    certain kinds of robots might need to recharge daily.

Susceptibility:

:   A certain substance hurts you. You are hindered
    while in its presence, and it may eventually be fatal. Example: a
    methane-breathing alien might find oxygen poisonous.

Taboo:

:   You are not permitted to do something that most people
    do. If you do it, major portions of your power will be blocked until
    the situation is remedied. E.g. A robot might be programmed to obey
    the Three Laws of Robotics, and malfunction or become catatonic if
    it ever accidentally harmed a human

Vulnerability:

:   A certain substance or kind of attack hurts you
    disproportionately. E.g. an alien with really sensitive hearing that
    is more easily hurt by sonic attacks. Your defenses against this kind
    of attack count as hindered, even the automatic ones, so you only
    roll one die for each defense.

Spending your Boosts
--------------------

You have a certain number of Boosts to spend on your character, usually
3. As you gain experience, you will be able to purchase more Boosts.
The number of XP you need to get an additional Boost is equal to your
current number of Boosts.

Each Boost can be spent for one of the following:

-   Add one to one of the four attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and
    Actions.

-   Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage. 2 Boosts
    give it a big Advantage.

-   Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.

-   Add one new power. The starting level is given in your template.

-   Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one
    Shtick at one higher level.

-   Get a companion, base, or vehicle. You can then spend additional Boosts
    to improve these.

-   Get three Assets. Assets are things like Favors, Contacts

-   You may increase an Ability by giving that Ability Disadvantages;
    a Small Disadvantage lets you increase it by 1 or give it a Small
    Advantage; a Big Disadvantage lets you: increase it by 2; add 2 Small
    Advantages; increase by 1 and add one Small Advantage; add a Big Advantage.

### Attributes {#sec:Attributes}

Boosts can be spent on increasing your Attributes. Attributes in Zap! are
characteristics that everybody has. Three of the Attributes are primarily
defensive, representing how much characters can resist various types
of Powers: Toughness, Will, and Stamina. The remaining Attribute,
Actions, is how many different things you can do in a Round. An ordinary
person has a score of 1 in each,
but player characters start with at least 2 in each. Having 3 in an
attribute would make you one of the world's toughest humans in that
respect, and a 5 or more is definitely superhuman.

#### Toughness {#sec:Toughness}

Toughness is how physically
durable you are. The higher your Toughness, the more likely you are
to avoid becoming Out (of the fight) due to most types of attack.

#### Will {#sec:Will}

Will is how mentally prepared and
determined you are. The higher your Will, the harder you are to Control
or put Out with a mental attack. You also get a bigger bonus when
making a Supreme Effort.

#### Stamina {#sec:Stamina}

Stamina is your endurance. It represents your ability to push beyond
your normal limits, as well as your resistance to certain unusual
forms of attack such as energy drains, being strangled or drowned.
The higher your Stamina, the harder you are to put Out with attacks
that weaken you, such as Energy Drain or Poison Gas. You can also
exert yourself more often by using Supreme Effort more frequently
and are less likely to be tired by invoking Failure is Not an Option!

#### Actions {#sec:Actions}

Actions is the number of distinct actions you
can take during a Round. Using an Active
Power counts as an Action even if you
don't end up rolling the dice, as does manipulating objects such as
opening a door, pressing a big red destruct button, or calling somebody
on a cell phone. For instance, if you use your Ice Mastery Power to
create a slide to catch a falling child you don't need to roll for
success, but it does still take one of your Actions for the Round.

Think of an Action as a single panel in a comic book, or a single
shot in a movie.

One thing to keep in mind is that you can only use most Powers once
per Round, and each use takes an Action; only Automatic
Powers can be used multiple times in a Round and don't cost an Action
to use. When creating your character you usually want to balance your
number of Powers with your Actions. If you have many Powers but few
Actions, you won't use most of your Powers in any one Round, although
it gives you a wide variety of Powers to pick from. If you have many
Actions but few regular Powers, many of your Actions will be spent
assisting teammates to recover or performing tasks that don't require
Powers, such as closing doors, kicking away dropped weapons, and so
on.

### Assets[\[sec:Assets\]]{#sec:Assets label="sec:Assets"}

Boosts can also be spent on Assets. Assets are things owned by your
character, such as Companions, Avatars, Vehicles, or Bases. Assets
can belong to a group rather than individual. If you are the crew
of a starship, the ship can belong to all of you. If a group shares
an Asset, they can divide up the costs arbitrarily. Each can contribute
a share of XP, including the XP needed for the first Boost needed
to purchase the Asset.

#### Companions {#sec:Companion}

Many characters in science fiction have assistants, servants, pets,
or trusted companions. Any type of creature can be a Companion, from
a flying, acid-spitting mini-dragon to a mindless android awaiting
your instructions, to a trusted friend.

One Boost gets you a Companion with all Attributes 1, three powers
at 5, and two Shticks at 4. Experience points spent on Companions
don't increase your hero's Boosts (and hence, do not increase the
XP Cost to buy future Boosts for you), but do increase Boosts a costs
for the Companion. It costs 1 XP to give your Companion 1 Boost. From
then on, it costs XP equal to the total number of Boosts your Companion
already has to give it an additional Boost. So a second XP gives it
a second Boost, then 2 more XP are required to give it a third. If
you want to give your Companions extra Boosts to start, you can trade
one of your Boosts for 3 XP and spend that on your Companion or other
Assets.

Not every friend or ally needs to be a Companion. What distinguishes
a Companion from a friend is that a Companion will obey you almost
unquestioningly, and are willing to place themselves in danger for
you.

#### Avatars[\[subsec:Avatars\]]{#subsec:Avatars label="subsec:Avatars"}

Certain kinds of Science Fiction stories, notably Cyberpunk, have
much of the activity take place in cyberspace or a virtual reality.
If this is a once-in-a-while activity in the game, it can be handled
as an ordinary Power (e.g. Hacking, Cybersystems) but if it's going
to be the basis of a lot of the action, the characters can have Avatars,
which are complete characters in their own right that exist only in
the VR/cyberspace setting. One Boost gets you an Avatar that's a complete
character, using whatever Template you choose; it need not be the
same Template as the real-world version of the character. When you
are using your Avatar in cyberspace, your "meatspace" character
is absorbed in what it's doing and gets no Actions. XP that you earn
can be spent on improving the Avatar instead in the same way that
you would improve your own character. The Avatar will interact with
objects and other Avatars in cyberspace just as characters do in the
game-world, though the way that cyberspace looks and behaves according
to the Primary Rule may vary considerably from the way the meatspace
world works; the GM and the players should take extra care to discuss
how it ought to work to avoid clashing assumptions and styles.

#### Vehicles {#sec:Vehicles}

Some characters have special Vehicles that allow
them to get to where the action is. Vehicles need not be at the same
Scope as the characters. Ones at the same Scope take the characters
from place to place within an adventure or can be used in combat scenes.
Spaceships will generally be on a completely different Scope from
the characters, and have their own Chapter on designing and using
them (see ). Vehicles can carry teammates and
cargo as well as you. You don't need a Vehicle as an Asset to have
a driver's license and car. Only purchase a Vehicle if it has special
abilities of its own, or you actually use it in a fight. A land-speeder
is just a hovercraft that takes you to the dives in the starport.
That wouldn't count as a Vehicle. But Serenity, the ship in Firefly,
is almost a character in its own right, and would certainly be bought
as a Vehicle.

You can describe your Vehicle as fitting any number of passengers,
but the larger it is, the more restricted it will be in going off-road,
landing, or docking as appropriate. You can give your Vehicle Boosts
as you would a Companion. The first Boost costs 1 XP, then the second
2, and so on. This does not count towards increasing your own Boosts.
If you trade one of your initial Boosts for 3 XP, you can thus use
this to improve your starting Vehicle by two Boosts.

Vehicles start with only Toughness as an Attribute, but you can purchase
Will and Actions. A Vehicle with 0 Actions can still use its Movement
power to move, since that costs 0 Actions. To use any other power,
or to use the Vehicles Movement to attack or defend, you would need
to use one of your own Actions. If you buy your Vehicle at least one
Action, it can perform independent actions. If it has zero Will, your
character must have trained or programmed it explicitly for these
actions. If it has a Will of at least 1, it has some kind of intelligence,
and can react to circumstances without explicit input from you.

You can also use a Boost to buy a spaceship, starting with one of
the base Ship Templates (equivalent to 10 Wealth Points); some campaigns
may be based around the players all being crew on a much more powerful
Ship, in which case the GM should just design the ship using whatever
budget seems sensible and the players need not spend any Boosts to
have it as an Asset.

#### Bases {#sec:Bases}

Characters often require a base of operations, where they can store
their equipment and mementos of their past adventures, keep their
labs and scientific equipment, and recharge their robotic bodies.
One Boost gets you an area or structure of any description, suitable
for occupation. It could be a building in an office park, a secret
asteroid base, a research compound on a private island, or perhaps
a huge warehouse in the middle of nowhere. The structure will have
Toughness 4 and other Attributes 0. It will have two Shticks at 4
usable by anyone inside, such as Research Library or First-Aid Kit.
XP can be spent to improve a base, just like for Companions and Vehicles.
You can give a base Attributes, Powers and Shticks. Powers and Shticks
are only usable inside the base, or at the perimeter, as appropriate.
If you don't give it any Actions, someone inside needs to use an Action
to trigger any non-Automatic Power. If you give it Actions but no
Will, the powers are programmable, following simple commands, and
do not require someone else to spend Actions. If you give it a positive
Will, there is some computer or other intelligence that controls the
base's powers, and can act independently.

##### Base Advantages {#sec:BaseAdvantages}

These Advantages apply only to Powers
that belong to the base, and apply to a specific Power of the base;
you can't, for instance, take the Advantage Remote-Controlled as an
advantage on the entire base and have it apply to all the Powers in
the base "for free." A base's Powers may also have Advantages
from the regular list, where appropriate.

Remote-Controlled (A)

:   Remote-Controlled Powers can be activated
    by a hero from outside the base, as long as he's still within the
    Scope; the Power would still take effect within the base (though for
    some things, like looking up records on a computer, that's not really
    a Disadvantage).

Long-Ranged (AA)

:   Long-Ranged Powers can be operated from within
    the base but targeted at things outside of the base, as long as they're
    still in-Scope. Powers would also need the Remote-Controlled advantage
    to be operated from outside of the base to target something outside
    of the base, e.g., a Teleporter that a hero could use to travel to
    the base.

Larger Scope (AA)

:   Larger Scope Powers can operate at a Scope
    above that of the base; this advantage can be taken multiple times,
    each time increasing the Power up by one level of Scope. A City-Scope
    base could thus have a scanner that could monitor an entire Region,
    or a teleporter capable of Interplanetary jumps.

#### Minor Assets {#sec:MinorAssets}

Some characters have special equipment, or perks, like security clearance
or law-enforcement authority, some have contacts in the underworld
or with the police, some are owed a big favor by somebody with unusual
resources or power, and some are well-known enough to influence people's
reactions to them for good or ill. These aren't exactly Abilities,
but they are capabilities that are similar in some ways. Minor Assets
come in several flavors: Equipment, Perks, Contacts, Favors, Wealth
and Rank. At creation a character can spend one Boost on **three**
Minor Assets appropriate to their Personal Scope. That is, if the
Personal Scope is Scope 5 (City), then their contact has City-wide
information/power/authority such as the Chief of Police or Mayor,
anchor of the local news, owner of a local company, while a National-Scope
Contact might be the President, CEO of a nation-wide corporation,
star of a nationally broadcast television program, or a Supreme Court
Justice.

Minor Assets can be adjusted up or down from the base Scope two-for-one.
So a City Contact could be traded for two Neighborhood contacts, or
four Street-level contacts; in the other direction two City Contacts
could be traded for one Regional Contact, and four could be traded
for one National Contact.

When rolling for the effect of a Minor Asset, that is where it's not
obvious from the nature of the Minor Asset and the Primary Rule whether
it would apply or be effective, roll the Asset's PL vs. a Difficulty
commensurate with the Scope. (See Difficulty for Other Tasks [\[subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks\]](#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks){reference-type="ref" reference="subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks"}.)
Minor Assets begin at PL 4 unless otherwise stated.

When spending XP, you can choose to purchase new Minor Assets, and
XP spent on Minor Assets doesn't increase your hero's Boosts. One
point of XP (not one Boost) purchases 1 Minor Asset at the current
Scope; increasing the Minor Asset's PL by 1 costs 1 *XP* for
the first increase, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and so on.

##### Equipment[\[subsec:Equipment\]]{#subsec:Equipment label="subsec:Equipment"}

Characters can begin with equipment appropriate to their Abilities
for free; the die-size of the Equipment is equal to the lower die
of the appropriate Power or Shtick, so this would be helpful in narrating
what they can do, but wouldn't actually increase the roll. E.g. if
the character has a power Photon Sword at PL 5, then a d4 Photon Sword
would be free (since PL 5 rolls a d6 and a d4); if the PL had been
6, then the Photon Sword would start at 6. Spending 1 XP increases
the *die-size* by one, 2 XP to increase it again, and so on;
thus for one Boost (3 XP), that could become a d8 Photon Sword. See
for a full discussion of Equipment.

##### Perks {#sec:Perks}

A Perk is a special dispensation or benefit that comes from the role
the character plays in the community or with an organization. For
instance, a character might be deputized by the local police force,
allowing him to make legally sanctioned arrests, but requiring him
to follow the same rules as to probable cause and evidence that the
police follow. Another character might have security clearance with
the Federal Government, or even a far-flung stellar empire. The effects
and restrictions for having a Perk are worked out through the Primary
Rule, though the GM might call for a roll of the Perk against the
Difficulty if there's some doubt as to whether the requested use is
truly sanctioned by the Perk.

##### Contacts {#sec:Contacts}

A Contact is somebody with access to information or authority who
can prove useful to the character. A contact might be a snitch in
the local underworld, a pal in the Star Knight records department,
the head of Interstellar Security Service, and so on, depending on
the Scope. Contacts will cooperate with the character in areas that
are within their competency and authority, but won't risk their lives
or their careers to help. Contacts might also call upon the character
to reciprocate. The effects and restrictions for having a Contact
are worked out through the Primary Rule, though the GM might call
for a roll of the Contact's PL vs. the Difficulty if there's some
doubt as to whether the contact really has the information or authority
needed. You don't need a separate roll to see if the Contact will
help; the roll of the Contact's PL vs. the Difficulty covers that:
failure could indicate the Contact won't help or can't help, depending
on the Primary Rule.

A Contact that would readily risk life and career to help the character
should be taken as if it were a Companion, even if the contact would
almost never accompany the character on an adventure.

##### Favors {#sec:Favors}

A Favor is something big that somebody owes the character--big enough
that they might actually risk their life or career to help. Favors
need not be owed to the character by Contacts or friends: the local
gang lord might owe the hero a debt of honor for saving the gang lord's
daughter's life, for instance. Favors can only be called in once,
and then are gone. You don't usually need to roll to see if the person
who owes you the favor will cooperate, but the GM might roll as with
Contacts above if there's some doubt whether the favor being asked
for is actually within the debtor's power to grant; if there's some
reason that the person isn't actually in the position to grant the
favor, the favor isn't used up.

##### Wealth[\[subsec:Wealth\]]{#subsec:Wealth label="subsec:Wealth"}

If the campaign is using the optional rules,
characters can start with Wealth as a Minor Asset. Wealth starts at
4, and can be increased like any Minor Asset (1 XP for the first increase,
2 for the second, etc.) but unlike most Minor Assets is likely to
increase or decrease during play, and not just as a result of spending
XP. If Wealth decreases during play, characters don't get any XP they
spent back. See for a full discussion of how
Wealth is used.

If you're not using the Wealth rules, or even if you are, characters
can be wealthy as part of their background or as a Shtick, but that
doesn't translate directly into buying and selling things; instead
it's handled narratively as part of the Primary Rule. I.e. a character
might justify trying to bribe her way to see the Emperor with her
Wealthy Shtick, but shouldn't just buy everybody on her ship d10 Powered
Armor by appealing to her Shtick instead of spending XP for it under
the Equipment rules.

##### Rank[\[subsec:Rank\]]{#subsec:Rank label="subsec:Rank"}

A character may have a rank within a particular organization; rank
acts much like a Contact, but it's the character's own authority that's
being exercised. The rank should be commensurate with the character's
*Adventure* Scope, rather than Personal Scope. You can be a general
without being able to fight like an army. Roll the PL in Rank vs.
the Difficulty set by the GM to determine whether your rank grants
you sufficient authority. If you roll a Mishap while pulling rank,
there should be repercussions, though the order may still be carried
out if the roll was a success.

Complications {#sec:Complications}
-------------

Every good character has things that complicate
life and add drama. It might be that in the eyes of the law, you are
a dangerous criminal, or maybe your uncle wants you to stay home and
be a moisture farmer instead of joining Star Academy. Perhaps you
are poor, and have to struggle to earn enough credits to keep your
rust-bucket starship flying. You should choose Complications to highlight
themes you want to be dealing with in the game. Complications are
invitations to the GM to focus on a particular aspect of your character
or kind of adventure you'd like to have. Every Zap! character has
roughly the same number and severity of Complications. You are perfectly
free to change your character's Complications between adventures;
if you want to stop focusing on your money problems for a while you
can tell the GM that and substitute a new Complication\...perhaps you
become the target of a local crime lord, who wants to recruit you
as a smuggler. Removing poverty as a Complication doesn't necessarily
mean that you're wealthy now, only that trying to earn enough credits
for day-to-day ship's expenses and repairs shouldn't crop up frequently
in adventures.

Most characters take one Big Complication and two Small Complications.
Crew have the option of having 4 Small Complications instead, since
their problems may be less of a character hook. A Big Complication
is something that will crop up almost all the time, and will form
one of the main themes of the character. Not every adventure will
incorporate it, but it will come as no great surprise if one does.
A Small Complication is one that only has an occasional impact, though
it might be a big deal when it does, or if it crops up frequently
it does so in a minor way. Complications can be chosen to be Big or
Small depending on your preference. As a Small Complication, being
Wanted by the Law might mean that you can't go to the police to ask
for information or assistance, and you leave your neatly-wrapped foes
for them to find, bugging out before they can arrest you too. As a
Big Complication, the police might actually try to arrest you in the
middle of a battle, or even aid your foe thinking that he must be
one of the good guys because he's fighting you!

Since Complications are a way to focus the attention on your character,
you don't want to take Complications that everyone in your group will
have, such as Hates Evil or Takes Risks.

### Note On Complications {#sec:NoteOnComplications}

Try
to avoid thinking of Complications as part of a price you have to
pay to the GM in order to play a cool alien creature or kick-ass cyborg
warrior; that can lead to picking a Complication that will annoy you
when it crops up\...but you're not playing the game in order to be
annoyed, and it's not the GM's job to keep you from having too much
fun. Ideally you should be looking forward to your Complications coming
up in an adventure, because it throws the spotlight on your hero and
gives you a chance to either have some drama or be clever and engage
in lateral thinking. Kryptonite wasn't introduced into Superman's
mythos in order to make it more fair, it was created to make it more
interesting. Having to rescue somebody from an area strewn with Kryptonite
presented a challenge that couldn't be solved by a straight application
of his awesome powers. When you choose Complications you should be
thinking in terms of what sort of problems would you like to be presented
with during play and whether those will actually be fun for you to
deal with. Don't over-think it, though; remember, in Zap! when you
get tired of a Complication you can simply set it aside and replace
it with a new one. Ultimately the goal of Complications is to help
the GM drive the game in directions that you find interesting.

Fleshing out Your Character {#sec:FinishingYourHero}
---------------------------

### Drive

Drive is a description of your character's primary motivation, what
makes her go off and explore strange new worlds and seek out new civilizations.
It could be curiosity, duty, vengeance, the desire for personal power,
protecting the innocent, or the quest for personal enlightenment.
Your Drive will help you role-play your character, and help the GM
come up with adventures that are interesting to you.

### Back-story {#sec:OriginAndBackground}

What happened before your character
decided to adventure? Did you attend an Academy that trained you?
Were you kidnapped from your home-world? Did you stow away on a starship,
seeking adventure or just an escape from the slums where you were
born? Or is it just a job to you, not an adventure at all? Who are
your family and friends? What do you do for a living? Describe the
character's back story in as much or as little detail as you like.
This is your opportunity to flesh out who your character is and what
she can do other than fight. You can add details about the character's
civilian life, profession and hobbies, friends and family, skills
and training, notable past adventures, and whatever else you think
is relevant.

Your back story need not be completely determined at the start of
play. Serial fiction is full of revelations of previously unmentioned
background details, from members of your family having been killed
decades before by this episode's villain, to the big bad actually
being your father and your love interest your sister. Players should
feel free to Retcon their character's pasts, though they should probably
clear it with the GM before they do the kind that actually contradicts
prior versions of the story, just in case the GM had built it into
the campaign in a way that would be hard to fix.

### Appearance {#sec:Appearance}

Think about what image your character projects. How will others see
her or him? Usually, your appearance is related to your true nature
in one of three ways. Your appearance could reflect your true nature
(a bad-ass who looks every bit a bad-ass), it could be adopted deliberately
to hide your true nature (a bad-ass who looks like Casper Milquetoast
because being underestimated is useful), or it could be an ironic
contrast to or statement about your true nature (the big scary-looking
alien who's poetic and sensitive).

In addition, a picture or description can help you resolve issues
when it comes to applying the Primary Rule. There will often come
times when you need to know whether your hero wears a closed helmet,
say, or gloves, or has any accessible gadgets hanging from her belt;
in these situations a picture can be worth a thousand words. Working
out such details in advance, incidental to designing your hero's appearance,
can speed play and free you from worrying about whether you're being
fair.

If you are more of a visual person, you might even want to draw or
use a computer sketch program to create an image of your character.

Alien templates {#alientemplates}
---------------

Here are some aliens suitable for PCs reminiscent
of various SF tales. Most campaigns would replace these or at least
add new ones to flesh out the setting. Aliens should be designed to
be able to work along side of humans (possibly using high technology)
or whatever the baseline sophont of the setting is, e.g. no aliens
that can only survive in an atmosphere that would be poisonous to
all the other player characters unless being trapped in an environment
suit is part of the challenge of playing that alien.

**Klangon Template**

Klangons are a race of boney-foreheaded aliens with a proud warrior
culture, a love of opera, and taste for prune juice.

**Attributes: Tough**: 4 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

Great Strength: 6 (d6, d6)

Hardiness: 6 (d6, d6) automatic defense

Combat Training: 6 Klangons are trained almost from birth in armed
and unarmed combat

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)
if they fit the stereotype

**New Powers:** The following will start at 6 if chosen: Armored
Exoskeleton (some Klangons elect to be permanently welded into their
battle-gear), Berserk (Klangons can go berserk, becoming nigh unstoppable:
treat as an automatic healing power that will Unhinder or work to
revive the Klangon if Out, after the battle the Klangon is Out even
if uninjured). Other powers unique to that particular Klangon may
be taken at 4.

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise

**Restrictions**: Psi Weakness: Klangons never defend against
Psi attacks with better than their Default Skill; Today Is A Good
Day To Die: Klangon culture forbids surrender or retreat, and any
Klangon known to have done so (even under direct orders) will be stripped
of all rank and honors and socially ostracized until he or she can
make good by dying spectacularly.

**Power Boosts**: Because Toughness was increased by 2, the Klangon
template needed 2 restrictions.

**Menton Template**

Mentons are relentlessly logical beings who've purged their society
of useless emotion, except for once every seven years when they binge
on it. Mentons are better than humans in practically every measurable
way, yet somehow always seem to find themselves in subordinate positions
to humans, who have the emotional drive to get things done.

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 2 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Logic**: 6 Mentons are relentlessly logical and capable of
lightning calculations of trajectories and probabilities that serves
them instead of formal combat training.

**Science**!: 6 Mentons are universally trained as scientists,
and have a Science! specialty just as if they were using the Scientist
template.

**Alien Metabolism**: 6 *automatic defense*. Mentons are
stronger, faster, and more resilient than humans, and many things
that would poison human won't work on Mentons. In addition they have
a rarely-noticed nictating membrane that can protect their eyes from
excessively bright lights that would be enough to blind humans permanently.

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)
if they fit the stereotype

**New Powers:** The following will start at 6 if chosen: Nerve
Punch (study of humanoid nervous systems lets them select targets

own memories on others with flesh-to-flesh contact)

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise

**Restrictions**: none

**Power Boosts**: none

**Deltan Template**

Deltans are shape-shifting telempaths. They have a reputation for
being somewhat flighty and emotional, but they often serve as ship's
psychologists.

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 3 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Shapeshift**: 6 Deltans can assume any form they've seen before,
of roughly the same mass; if that form has special non-technological,
non-psi powers such as claws, stings, or acid breath, they will have
those powers while in that form.

**Telempathy**: 6 Deltans can sense and project emotions.

**Regeneration**: 6 *automatic defense*. (A) Flexible. Deltans
are hard to hurt for very long.

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)

Bond (Can form a permanent telepathic bond with one other, allowing
two way communication of more than just emotions)

Art, Disguise, Acting

**Restrictions**: Deltans must spend 1 hour out of every 24 in
a quiescent chrysalis form.

**Power Boosts**: Deltans have one power boost, to account for
the Flexible Advantage on their regeneration.

**Warbot Template**

Warbots are robots equipped and programmed for combat.

**Attributes: Tough**: 4 **Will**: 3 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Armored Body**: 6 Warbots are heavily armored, and as robots
do not need to breath or eat, and are immune to things like poison
and disease.

**Incinerator Beam**: 6 Warbots typically have one heavy-duty
attack.

**Shticks**: 2 Shticks @ 3 (d4) or 4 (d4, d4)
if they fit the stereotype

Jet, Ship's Gunner, Force Field, Riot Gas

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise.
Typical Shticks are Calculation, Tactics, Computer Interface, Military
History, Politics, Use Military Equipment, Repair

**Restrictions**: Warbots have a manual off switch as a fail-safe.

**Power Boosts**: Warbots have one power boost, to up their Toughness
by 1

**Diplomatron**

Diplomatrons are protocol bots, used as translators and diplomatic
aides.

heads around).

**Shticks**:

**Languages** 5

**Politics** 5

**New Powers:** The following will start at 6 if chosen: Psychological/Social
defenses such as "Let's talk this over."

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise:
Typical Shticks are any knowledge or cultural Shticks except things
like intimidation or interrogation.

**Restrictions**: Pacifist (personal only, doesn't try to dissuade
others from violence).

**Power Boosts**: Diplomatrons have one boost, to raise Languages
and Politics Shticks by 1.

**Servo-Unit**

Servo-units are trashcan-shaped robots that are adept at interfacing
with, controlling and repairing the software of other machines and
robots.

**Attributes: Tough**: 2 **Will**: 3 **Stamina**: 2
**Actions**: 2

**Powers**:

**Interface**: 6 (AA) Control. Servo-Units can control computers,
machinery, and other robots, provided they can physically interface
with them.

**Not Worth Noticing**: 6 Servo-Units are small and unassuming,
and are so common in any civilized high-tech facility that they generally
are unnoticed as they go about their business, even during a firefight.

**Regeneration**: 6 *automatic defense*. (A) Flexible. Deltans
are hard to hurt for very long.

**Shticks**:

**Repair** 6 (DD) need to be able to control something else if
repair requires physical manipulation

**Navigation** 4

Systems such as Gunner or Pilot

**New Shticks:** Start at 4 if they fit the stereotype, 3 otherwise.
Typical Shticks: any sort of engineering or mechanical knowledge.

**Restrictions**: No manipulative limbs; can understand but not
speak common languages.

**Power Boosts**: Deltans have one power boost, to account for
the Flexible Advantage on their regeneration.

Playing Zap! {#sec:PlayingZap}
============

Quick Summary
-------------

Here's a quick summary of the mechanical options in Zap! Any option
you take must be justified by describing what you're doing according
to the Primary Rule. Further details on each are supplied in the following
chapters, but this is the essence of the game.

-   **Attack** Spend an Action. Roll 2 dice, take higher.

-   **Use Ability** spend an Action. Roll vs. GM-assigned Difficulty
    to succeed.

-   **Defend** Defend with an Automatic or spend an Action to defend
    with a regular Power. If Attacker's roll beats yours, you are Hindered;
    if it beats it by *more* than your Attribute, you are Out (vs.
    Toughness)/Tired (vs. Stamina)/Influenced (vs. Will).

-   **Counter** Spend Action to roll Ability against Ability to prevent
    it succeeding; Countered character can choose not to contest the roll
    but abort instead (reuse the action and Ability for something else),
    or can spend an *extra* Action to use a different Ability to
    contest the Counter roll.

-   **Combine** Each participant spends one Action per Ability they
    are contributing. Roll dice based on which Ability's Advantages you
    want to use, +1 per Ability involved (Max bonus = number of players,
    no more than +1 from any one character).

### Tropes

Tropes are variations on the basic rules that provide a better fit
for specific things typical of the genre.

-   **Wild Shot** Swap 2 matched dice for 1 die next size higher
    (or drop low die for +1 on high if mismatched).

-   **Disable** Power vs. Ability to temporarily disable the target
    Ability; Hinder means it's unusable until the owner spends an Action;
    Out is unusable until the owner spends a Turn fixing it; Overkill
    needs out-of-combat repair. Automatic Defenses are immune, unless
    the attacking Power has the Disabling Only Advantage.

-   **Failure is Not an Option!** Can opt to become Hindered to change
    a non-combat roll to highest possible (if this would require a larger
    adjustment than your Stamina, become Tired).

-   **Splitting Powers** Split roll into single die at two different
    targets, -1 die size for each doubling of number of targets after
    that. (4 targets is -1, 8 is -2, etc.)

-   **Careful Aim** Take half the largest die instead of rolling;
    no Collateral Damage. Not while Hindered.

    -   **Pull Your Punch** No Overkill

-   **Supreme Effort** Add Will to die roll. May try Supreme Effort
    *after* roll is made if you spend an extra Action. Become Tired;
    Stamina drops by 1.

-   **Sheer Determination** Spend 1 Will to become completely Unhindered.

-   **Chase** Spend an Action to change range; may be Countered by
    a Move vs. Move/Search vs. Hide contest. Ranges are Combat Range,
    Pursuit Range, Lost Contact.

-   **Aid** Spend an Action to completely Unhinder an ally.

-   **Revive/Finish Off** Spend all your Actions in a Round to bring
    an ally back from Out, or to prevent an enemy from recovering from
    Out.

-   **Intimidate** spend an Action to Attack vs. Best Power and Will
    to cow foe, (Hinder = hesitates/considers cooperating, Out = surrenders/flees);
    each die reduced by a die-size if vs. multiple foes at once.

-   **Jury Rig** cobble together a new Ability by combining Abilities
    (choose one as base, +1 PL for each other contributing power), the
    contributed Abilities are Burned Out for the rest of the Scene; if
    that's not appropriate the contributor becomes Tired instead.

-   **This Ends Now!** Both sides agree to resolve entire confrontation
    in straight up roll; higher side wins decisively, losers are captured
    or otherwise out of the picture.

-   **Boldly Go** volunteer to be "gaffed with the plot hook"
    to move the adventure along; gain 1 XP.

Defining Abilities {#sec:DefiningPowers}
------------------

In Zap!, most of what a character can do is represented by Abilities;
Abilities are divided into Powers and Shticks. Powers are Abilities
potentially useful in combat, Shticks are all other Abilities. For
instance if a character is extremely strong, the character has the
Power "Super Strength." Strength at ordinary levels, even for
a gifted athlete, isn't recorded and only rarely has any effect on
the mechanics of the game. Characters are assumed to be relatively
normal in every aspect that isn't specifically identified as being
so exceptionally good as to amount to a Power or Shtick, or so bad
as to be a Complication. You are completely free to choose what your
Powers and Shticks are, their names, and descriptions of how they
work. How many you get and how they interact with other Abilities
are governed by the game mechanics.

The most important aspect of Abilities is conceptual: what does it
do? Two Abilities might be mechanically identical, but if one is Super
Strength, and the other is a Laser Beam, how they are used and what
they can accomplish are different. In Zap!, it is never sufficient
to simply invoke the Ability and roll the dice for the mechanical
effect. The Primary Rule of "Does this
sound like an SF story?" must be obeyed. If the goal is to free
a civilian trapped beneath a car, the player could use Super Strength
to lift the car off, or a Laser Beam to cut the civilian free, but
if the player can't come up with a plausible way for the Ability to
accomplish the task (for instance trying to free somebody trapped
beneath a car with an Ability that can only be used to engulf an area
in flames, or that creates intangible illusions) then the action isn't
permitted.

Note that it only needs to be plausible in terms of SF stories; it's
not recommended that you really try to justify the physics in real-world
terms. Worrying about whether, even given Super Strength, the character
can actually find enough leverage and the car has sufficient structural
integrity to be lifted from particular hand-holds is not something
that any but the most hard-core SF stories do. On the other hand,
you don't want to have the game degenerate into farce when the character
uses Super Strength to just reach in and lift the water out of a swimming
pool, at least without somebody freezing it first.

The decision of whether a particular use of a Power or Shtick is sufficiently
SF-plausible in Zap! should be left up to the players instead of
delegated to the GM. Players continuously asking whether a particular
action is permissible will slow things down and interrupt the flow.
As long as all the players bear in mind that they should be limiting
themselves to the kind of actions that they would like to read about
or see in a movie, and avoid the sorts of things that would make them
roll their eyes or snicker if they were the audience, minor disagreements
over plausibility should be overlooked to keep the action flowing.
Remember as well that there's often more than one way to accomplish
something with an Ability; reaching into a swimming pool and lifting
the water out with your Super Strength is silly, but stomping the
ground so hard the swimming pool cracks and the water drains out makes
perfect genre sense.

The corollary to the Primary Rule is that in Zap! the description
*is* the ability. If something sounds like a SF story, it should
be valid, even if there are no specific game mechanics permitting
it. The mechanics, and in particular what dice you throw, are there
as an aid to figuring out what happens when one Power or Shtick is
pitted against another, or against the circumstances, but the determining
factor should be what the description of the Ability implies it ought
to be able to do. How do you know if the Flame Blast can overcome
the Ice Shield thrown up as a defense? You roll the dice. How do you
know if the Flame Blast can set a bunch of papers on fire? It just
can, because that's what makes sense. Actions that are squarely within
the concept of the Ability don't require justification or rolls. Actions
that are clearly outside of the scope of the Ability shouldn't be
attempted, no matter how high a Power Level you have. Can an Ice Shield
protect you against Telepathic Assault? Seems unlikely, so don't roll
for it. Again, if it seems borderline whether it should be allowed
or not, go with the player's interpretation. That puts a lot of power
in the hands of the player, but remember: with great power comes great
responsibility!

#### Ability Examples {#sec:PowerExamples}

Here are some
examples:

**Example 1**: You've given your hero a Power called Clone, which
allows him to make duplicates of himself. When you try to use this
Power in combat to create a squad of yourself and all tackle the foe,
you roll the dice based on the Power Level of your Power and compare
that to the foe's defenses, just as if you had used a Power such as
Fire Blast. Bear in mind that according to the Primary Rule you might
require further justification or explanation depending on the circumstance:
if the enemy is flying hundreds of feet up, just tackling him outright
is implausible; you would have to further justify the action by doing
something like combining it with Jump-jets, or being thrown by a companion
with Super Strength and then Cloning yourself in mid-air once you'd
hit the enemy.

If you want to use your Clone Power to create a duplicate who will
go converse with the guards to distract them while the other you sneaks
into the warehouse, you don't need to roll anything; the description
of the Power clearly implies that you ought to be able to do that,
and that's all it takes.

**Example 2**: Your hero has the Power Weather Control, and is
trying to prevent the enemy space marine from kidnapping the Ambassador.
Since space marine's powered armor has so far been too tough for your
direct attacks using Weather Control to create lightning, you decide
to try to conceal the Ambassador's location by whipping up a fog bank.
Assuming the space marine has no Power granting him senses that would
let him penetrate the fog, he'll have to beat your roll on Weather
Control with his Default Skill in order to locate the Ambassador.
The effect will last until the space marine uses an appropriate Power
to blow the fog away, or it disperses naturally.

If you had chosen to try to blind the space marine directly with your
fog, you would roll against the space marine's appropriate defense
(again the Default Skill unless he had an appropriate heightened sense),
and if successful would result in him being Hindered;
it would last until he spent an Action to do something that would
clear it or move himself out from under. In this case, if you had
rolled well enough to score an Out, the Out result would be interpreted
as the space marine stumbling around blindly, unable to take effective
action.

**Example 3**: The enemy is attempting to use his Telekinesis
to lift your character into the air. Your character's Automatic Defense
is Invulnerability; while that would protect you from a telekinetic
blow, there doesn't seem to be any logical reason that would prevent
it from lifting you, so you wouldn't get to use it to defend. If your
Movement Power were, say, Flight, then it is conceivable that you
could attempt to resist the Telekinesis by Flying in the opposite
direction, but you would have to spend an Action to use it (unlike
the Automatic Defense); also, since it's a Movement Power it would
only defend with a single die. Because anything that makes sense according
to the Primary Rule would be allowed, you could also use something
like Super Strength to resist by grabbing on to a nearby object or
even digging your fingers into the ground; again that would take an
Action and be your one use of that Power in the Round.

### Disagreements {#sec:Disagreements}

Disagreements or uncertainty over whether the use of an Ability follows
from the description should be resolved in favor of the player; the
GM should feel free to point out considerations that the player might
have overlooked, such as the enemy being hundreds of feet in the air,
and encourage the player to consider whether the use of the Ability
is in keeping with the Primary Rule
and to modify or abandon it if it's not.

It's also legitimate for the GM to reveal information that the player
might not have known that has bearing on the proposed use of the Ability,
or even render it moot. For instance: Ace Astra attempts to use her
Freeze Ray-gun to form an ice slide to catch a toddler plummeting
towards her doom. Ordinarily that would be a perfectly valid use of
the Power, but if the GM knows that it's actually a hologram of a
child rather than a real child, when the player announces "I use
my Freeze Ray-gun to create a slide and catch her" before the player
continues with describing what she'll do once she's caught the child,
the GM should inform her that the child passes right through the slide
without stopping or slowing. It's possible that in some of these cases
the GM should rule that the Ability just doesn't work as proposed
without revealing exactly why, if there is something going on that
the character can't be aware of, but the GM should make every effort
to at least describe to the players what does happen or appears to
happen instead rather than flatly declaring "That didn't work."

### Power Level {#sec:PowerLevel}

All Powers and Shticks are rated as to their Power Level.
Power Level determines the number of dice rolled when pitting that
Ability against another Ability or to try and perform some task while
under stress, as well as how much the Ability can do in real-world
terms: how fast, how heavy, how big? Each level in Power Level substantially
increases the effect, ranging from a 50% increase per level at Street
Scope to 64 times as much per level at Cosmic Scope.

Power Levels are assigned dice equivalent and when rolling for the
effect of an Ability, you roll the two dice listed and take the higher
result. In Zap! you never add the dice together.

   **PL**  Dice         **PL**  Dice
  -------- ----------- -------- --------------
   **2**   single d2    **10**  d10, d10
   **3**   single d4    **11**  d12, d10
   **4**   d4, d4       **12**  d12, d12
   **5**                **13**  d8+5, d12
   **6**   d6, d6       **14**  d12, d8+5
   **7**   d8, d6       **15**  d8+5, d8+5
   **8**   d8, d8       **16**  d8+5, d10+5
   **9**   d8, d10      **17**  d10+5, d10+5

Note that the Power Levels follow an easy-to-remember
pattern: at even levels you use two dice of the same size, and that
size matches the level; odd levels have one die of the next higher
level and one of the next lower. Power Levels beyond 12 are not common,
generally only appearing when characters of different Scopes face
one another.

### Regular Powers {#sec:RegularPowers}

Regular Powers can be used to attack or defend, as well as whatever
else the description of the Power implies; just because Powers can
be used in combat to attack or defend doesn't mean they can't be used
for other purposes. On the other hand Shticks *cannot* be used
to attack or defend: if it seems plausible that you could use an ability
to hinder or harm somebody, or to protect yourself, you should make
it a Power.

If you use a Power to defend during a Round it will defend against
all the subsequent attacks during the Round as long as there's a reasonable
Primary Rule explanation of how it applies. E.g., once you've decided
to use your Powered Armor to defend yourself that Round versus an
attack with toxic gas by sealing up the vents and going to internal
oxygen, you will continue to be able to defend against new attacks
that same Round with your Powered Armor even if it requires a different
Primary Rule explanation of how the armor ought to apply. Even defending
with a Power that requires more activity than that, say using Acrobatics
to jump around and dodge, would apply to all the attacks during the
Round for which Acrobatics makes sense as a defense.

### Movement Powers {#sec:MovementPowers}

Movement Powers primarily let you move around, whether getting to
the scene of the adventure, chasing a bad-guy or in combat. They may
also be used to attack or defend, where that makes sense according
to the Primary Rule (e.g., using fly to ram into a foe, or super speed
to dodge bullets), and may be combined with other Powers.

Movement Powers take an Action if you want to change Range categories
or use them for attack or defense; when used to attack or defend,
Movement Powers use only one of their dice. Movement with a Movement
Power within a Range category doesn't take an Action, it's just part
of the narration of your turn; if you don't have a Movement Power,
you are presumed to be using your Default Skill when moving around
during your turn, and that will take an Action.

Your Movement Power can open or close Range with a foe by one Range
category per Round (Combat Range » Pursuit Range » Lost Contact).
The approximate distance a range increment represents will vary by
Scope. Combats will either begin at Combat Range, or at Pursuit Range
if the characters first catch sight of the enemies (or vice-verse)
at a distance. Range doesn't change unless the combatants are deliberately
trying to manipulate the range to their advantage.

You cannot use a Movement Power to change Range categories and to
attack or defend in the same Round.

### Shticks {#sec:Shticks}

Shticks are Abilities that can only be used for things *other
than* attack and defense, for instance to heal an ally, or search
an area. They can be used during combat, as long as they aren't used
as an attack or defense. For example, it's perfectly legitimate to
use your Thievery Shtick to attempt to pick a lock while a fight rages
around you; it's not allowed to use your Thievery Shtick to defend
yourself from somebody trying to shoot you by hiding in shadows or
blocking with your lock-picks--if you want to be able to do that
sort of thing buy it as a Power instead.

Shticks start at the level indicated in your Template (e.g. 4 for
Bad-Asses, 5 for Crew). Shticks may take more than one Round to use
where that would be logical, e.g. combing a library for clues is likely
to take longer than a fraction of one Round. If you start to use a
Shtick for something that will take several Rounds and decide you
would rather do something else, you can stop at any time, though you
won't regain any already spent Actions. Whether you can resume your
partially completed task later or your effort so far will be lost
will depend on what would be logical given what you were doing. A
partially-built device will likely wait, a partially-delivered speech
to rally the troops, not so much.

Shticks are what Zap! has instead of such
things as skills or talents that are common in other systems. If you
are an extraordinarily good detective, engineer, or archaeologist,
good enough that you would regularly rely on that ability in your
adventures, that would be a Shtick; if being a detective or engineer
was merely a day job that might crop up once in a while depending
on the situation, that would just be part of your Background. Having
it as part of your Background doesn't mean you are mediocre at it--you
might still be world-class, but it does mean that the adventures you
have don't typically call on your skills in that regard. If a roll
is required to employ a skill implied by your Background, roll the
Default Skill (a single d4); if you have nothing in your Background
that might be applicable you roll a single d2.

Of course, Shticks also represent genuine superhuman
abilities such as X-Ray vision, Telempathy, a portal to an alternate
dimension, and so on. Abilities that you don't intend to use all the
time should generally be in this category unless it's important that
they be useful to attack or defend.

Shticks that can be used for movement are presumed not to be usable
in combat. E.g., you could have an ordinary helicopter, or even an
extraordinary satellite-based teleporter, as a Shtick to get you from
mission to mission provided it was slow or cumbersome enough that
you couldn't use it to flit around while fighting. If you wanted to
be able to fight while using it, you would take it as Movement Power
or a Vehicle instead.

To use a Shtick that gives you
some kind of connection or "in" with an authority roll your Shtick
against the Scope of the intended connection as the Power Level, e.g.
a Famous Actor or Business leader trying to impress the mayor of a
City would roll against PL 5 (since Cities are Scope 5+), so would
roll the Shtick against d6, d4.

The amount you beat the difficulty by is your degree of success:

For Shticks that give information
use the following interpretation:

This also holds for powers, but Shticks are more likely to be used
to gain information. Shticks can be combined
with powers using the combining powers rule, but not to attack or
defend. In combat, Shticks take an Action
to use. Out of combat they take a variable
amount of time, as is appropriate to the situation. A medical knowledge
Shtick might take only a glance to identify that a corpse has a missing
liver, or days of study to investigate the medicinal uses of a rare
compound found in an alien laboratory.

### Active vs. Automatic {#sec:ActivevsAutomatic}

All Powers are either Active or Automatic, depending on when and whether
they require an Action to use. Shticks are neither; whether a Shtick
requires you to spend an Action depends on what you're doing with
it. E.g. picking a lock would require an Action, while recognizing
whether an alien is of a known type based on your Xenobiology Shtick
would not.

#### Active Powers {#sec:ActivePowers}

Any Power that requires an Action to use is Active. Active Powers
never trigger unless you spend an Action to activate them. Each Active
Power may only be used once per Round, no matter how many Actions
you have, though you may use as many *different* Active Powers
as you have Actions. Once you spend an Action on an Active Power in
order to defend, it will continue to defend you until the beginning
of your next turn (when you would have to spend another Action to
renew it), even against new attacks.

#### Automatic Powers {#sec:AutomaticPowers}

Automatic Powers are used automatically whenever certain conditions
are met, and don't cost an Action to use. What those conditions are
and what the Power does are determined when you take the Power. An
Automatic Power may be used either for attack or defense, not both.
For instance, Armor might be an Automatic Defense that would be used
whenever you were physically attacked. Flaming Body could be Automatic
Attack that would be used whenever you were grabbed. Automatic Defenses
defend against every appropriate incoming attack, Automatic Attacks
attack everyone, friend or foe, who meets the proper conditions. Powers
that don't directly attack or defend may be chosen as Automatic, and
will activate whenever is appropriate; a common example might be an
Automatic sense, which would be active whenever something perceptible
was within range.

Automatic Powers can combine with other Powers if the conditions for
triggering the Automatic Power occur at the same time as another Power.
That is, if you had Flaming Body as an Automatic Attack, and Super
Strength, and you grabbed somebody with your Super Strength and squeezed
them, the conditions for the Flaming Body would apply and you could
choose to attack by Combining your Super Strength and Flaming Body.
However, whenever you Combine an Automatic Power with another, the
base power is the *weaker* of the two powers. E.g. if your Super
Strength was PL 10 and your Flaming Body was PL 6, the Combination
would be an attack at PL6+1, not PL10+1. You would have to spend an
Action for your Super Strength, but not for your Automatic Flaming
Body.

Automatic Movement moves you whenever the proper condition occurs,
e.g., a enemy might have an Automatic Teleport that emergency teleports
him back to his lair when he is Out; Automatic Movement Powers can
take effect even if you've already moved that round, or even if you're
Out as in the example, but they can never be used to attack or defend,
nor activated except by meeting the proper conditions.

#### Senses as Powers or Shticks

Senses should generally be bought as a Powers, unless there's a good
reason they can't be used to defend you by alerting you to danger
or let you attack something that you couldn't otherwise sense. E.g.
a Mind Meld where you have to touch the target and concentrate deeply
could be a Shtick. Whether senses are Automatic or not depends

![image](TomCorbett.png){width="100%"}

on whether you have to concentrate to use them, e.g. Infra-Vision
or a reflexive Danger Sense vs. X-Ray vision that you have to deliberately
turn on. A sense that's defined as an Automatic Defense could still
be used as part of a Primary Rule justification for attacking something
that would otherwise be invisible, but you'd still need some other
Power to make the attack.

Using Abilities {#sec:UsingPowers}
---------------

#### The Primary Rule {#sec:ThePrimaryRule}

The Primary Rule of Zap! is that actions have to make sense in a
SF kind of way. In order to justify using an Ability, you have to
describe using the Ability in a way that makes sense\...at least according
to the genre conventions. Decisions as to whether that particular
use of a Ability ought to be allowed rest with the player, though
the GM or other players are permitted to point out if they think the
player is pushing it; the GM is also encouraged to point out circumstances
that the player ought to take into account when deciding how to use
the Ability (such as the enemy currently hovering 300 feet in the
air, or holding a hostage in front of him), and it's ultimately up
to the GM to decide on and describe the effect of using the Ability
on the environment or the foes, as long as he does so in a way that
doesn't countermand the player's description of the attempt.

The player should stop short of describing the reaction, although
saying what she's trying to do is fine: "I pick up a chair and hurl
it at the alien" or "I try to lasso the flying alien and pull
it out of the air" are good, while "I pick up a chair and hurl
it at the flying alien, knocking him out of the air and pinning him
beneath it" isn't as good. When describing your attempts you should
leave room for either the dice or circumstances unknown to you to
intervene.

Another example: if the player wishes to hit the enemy using his Super
Strength, even though the enemy is 300 feet in the air, he can announce
that he grabs a nearby lamp-post and hurls it at the enemy. The GM
can remind the player that they are currently in the desert, so maybe
it should be a rock, and the GM can rule that the lamppost/rock passes
through the enemy harmlessly (because unbeknown to the player at the
moment, it's just a hologram), but the GM shouldn't override the player
to say there are no lampposts, rocks, or anything else suitable to
throw or that the throw falls short without giving the player a chance
to roll to see if the Super Strength Power succeeds in overcoming
the enemy's defense.

The goal of the system it to make everything simple, fast, and exciting;
negotiation every round between the players and the GM as to what's
permissible and what objects are in the environment and whether any
die-rolls are needed to see if the character can use them just slow
things down and break the flow. In SF adventures there's always an
object of the right size around to pick up and chuck if that's what
the character wants to do. Similarly as long as the fight is taking
place in an area where there are such things as fire hydrants or high-voltage
lines, then they are assumed to be within reach and ready to be deployed
with the appropriate Abilities. The players are entitled to make up
such features of the environment as seem plausible as they go about
describing their actions.

#### The Primary Rule And The Default Skill {#sec:ThePrimaryRuleAndTheDefaultSkill}

If you need to make a roll and you don't have an appropriate Ability
according to the Primary Rule, you roll your Default Skill instead.
This happens most often when your Defenses aren't applicable. In Zap! you
never resist an attack with your bare Attribute, you always have some
chance of mitigating the attack somehow. The Default Skill also represents
using a skill implied by your Background that isn't
one of your Powers, as well as using one of your Minor Powers. When
using your Default Skill this way, roll PL 3 (a single d4) if there's
any way of justifying it by your Background, and PL2 (a single d2)
if you can't. Normal people will roll PL 3 (d4) in the areas that
they're trained in, and a PL 2 (d2) for anything else.

### Uncontested Abilities {#sec:UncontestedPowers}

When
trying to perform an uncontested feat roll the Ability and then compare
the roll to the Difficulty
set by the GM.

When you roll for the result of an uncontested Ability, the result
is always interpreted relative to the Scope of the character; even
if two characters have Super Strength at PL 6, if one is Neighborhood
Scope and the other is Global Scope the latter is able to lift much
greater weights.

#### When To Roll Uncontested Abilities {#sec:WhenToRollUncontestedPowers}

Remember, if it's obvious that the Ability
ought to succeed by the Primary Rule,
rolling isn't necessary. Much of the time Zap! assumes that feats
such as picking up crates, flying your fighter, or jumping from your
hover-tank onto the enemy hover-tank are incidental to the action.
Picking up a nearby car and hurling it at the enemy with your Super
Strength isn't two actions, one of attempting to pick up the car and
another of hitting the enemy with it; it's a single attack that happens
to be narrated as using a convenient piece of scenery in accordance
with the Primary Rule of sounding like an SF story. Chances are that
the player taking the action invented the car being there for that
purpose; it would make no mechanical difference if it had been a dumpster,
mailbox, or just the character's fists, so there is no reason to interrupt
and say "Wait, can your character lift a car? Roll for it." The
only reason to make an uncontested check is when there is both a reason
to care about the outcome, and genuine doubt about whether the character
is up to the task. For instance, if the enemy hurls a car and the
character wants to try to catch it so that the passengers aren't injured
it would be reasonable to check, and roll if it would be past the
limit of what the Ability is normally capable of, such as using a
PL 6 Ability at Neighborhood Scope to catch a medium-sized car.

#### Difficulty {#sec:Difficulty}

The Difficulty for exerting your Abilities to accomplish *specific*
effects appropriate to the Ability (such as using Super Strength to
lift an object) is based off of the Power Levels for the Scope. The
maximum die roll represents the *maximum* the Ability is capable
of without Supreme Effort, Wild Shot, or combining
with another Ability.

Chart 11.1 on the next page summarizes Difficulty 6 for each Scope
(that is, what it would take a roll of 6 to do) to give you a quick
idea, but you should see Appendix for a list of the effects for each
Power Level and the real-world equivalents in weight and speed. Not
every Ability or every use of a Ability will directly translate into
weight or speed, and many characters will have at least some Abilities
above the base but the charts give you a general feel for the order
of magnitude that Abilities of a given level might represent.

  ------------------- ---------------- ------------------------------- ------------------ ------------------------ -------
  Scope               **Weight**       example                         **Speed**                                   +1

  ------------------- ---------------- ------------------------------- ------------------ ------------------------ -------

E.g., Difficulty 6 at Regional Scope is equivalent in weight to a
medium car (2 metric tons), so a character at that Scope with Ability
like Super Strength or Telekinesis would roll her Ability against
Difficulty 6 to lift the car. Obviously, if the character's Ability
was PL 8 (d8, d8) this would be easier to do than if they were using
a PL 6 (d6, d6) Ability.

Say your character at the Neighborhood Scope wants to lift a medium
car, weight 2 tons: that's a 9 referring to the chart in the Appendix.
If you have Enhanced Strength PL 6 that will require hitting Difficulty
9 on his d6, d6. You would need use some combination of Wild Shot,
Supreme Effort, and possibly Combining Powers
or getting help from another character to achieve that. Supposing,
though, that your Strength was at PL 10 (d10, d10), you would be able
to do it without any special effort if you roll well. If you don't,
you can change the roll to a success by paying a penalty (See Failure
is Not an Option!) Remember, though, that if it's not important you
shouldn't be rolling.

#### Difficulty for Other Tasks {#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks}

When in doubt about the Difficulty for a task, and it's not something
that the character clearly ought to be able to do just through invoking
the Primary Rule, use the following table a rule of thumb:

  Task Could be Done By    Difficulty
  ----------------------- ------------
  Normal                       2
  Expert Normal/Agent          3
  Bad-ass/Crew                 4
  Squad of Agents              6
  Party of Adventurers         8
  Party using Research         10
  Jury-rigged gadget           12

This assumes that the task is not something that's routine for the
kind of person listed, but rather it's toward the outer edge of their
abilities. For instance, a normal would have a PL 2 (d2), in her profession,
an expert normal would have PL 3 (d4) and an agent perhaps PL 4 (d4,
d4), so the difficulties are set so they may well fail. Tasks that
should be easier than that for them ought not to require a roll in
the first place.

### Contested Abilities {#sec:ContestedPowers}

When rolling a Ability contested by another Ability, such as an attack
vs. a defense, both Abilities roll and the higher number wins. The
amount the higher number exceeds the lower is the Damage. Zero Damage
is still a success for Player Characters, but a failure for NPCs.

##### Ties {#sec:Ties}

Ties go to the player, or if two NPCs are making opposed rolls, to
the attacker. Your attacks merely have to match the enemy's defense
to have some effect, though you still need to *beat* their Attribute
to score an Out. The enemies need to beat your defenses before you're
affected. At higher Power Levels ties are relatively rare, but at
low levels this edge is what separates characters from mooks.

#### Defending {#sec:Defending}

When you attack other characters, the defenders get to announce what
they are doing to Defend themselves, which can include spending Actions
on Active Powers to aid in their defense. The defenders need to remember
how many Actions they use and which Active Powers they employ, so
that when their Turns come around they don't re-use them. Remember,
you can only use an Active Power once per turn, and it costs an Action
to use any Active Power to defend yourself. If the defender's Turn
was earlier in the Round, she can only use Active Powers to defend
herself if she has both Actions and unused Powers remaining.

### Damage {#sec:Damage}

Most of the time, opposed rolls take place when one character is trying
to damage another. If the attack is a success, subtract the defense
roll from the attack roll: the result is the Damage. You then compare
the Damage to the defender's appropriate score. For most attacks,
that will be their Toughness; if you have an appropriate Advantage
it might be compared to Will or Stamina instead. The possible results
are the opponent are Hindered, Tired, Out, Controlled,
or Overkill.

  ----------- ---------- ------------ -----------------
                                      
               \<= Attr    \> Attr     \> Attr **+ 3**
  Toughness                  Out          Overkill
  Stamina                   Tired            Out
  Will                    Influenced         Out
  ----------- ---------- ------------ -----------------

Zap! has no specific mechanical provisions for death; depending
on the tone you're going for you can include death of PCs and NPCs
as a potential result of Overkill, or as one of the results of applying
the Primary Rule, or something that happens once in a while but only
as a result of the plot (as when the characters don't arrive in time
to disarm a bomb), or as an additional action taken against an Out
foe. For a particularly grim tone along the lines of a movie such
as Alien, you could actually make Out equal to dead as long as you
were prepared to keep creating new characters.

When you use a Power, there's a chance that you'll cause Collateral
Damage. At the GM's discretion and according to the Primary Rule the
lower die roll may be applied as damage to nearby people and objects.

#### Collateral Damage {#sec:CollateralDamage}

SF battles are famous for the amount of destruction they wreak on
the surroundings. At the GM's discretion attacks made can be checked
to see if they cause Collateral Damage. If you hit a foe with your
fist, you probably won't cause Collateral Damage unless you knock
him flying into something; if you hit a foe with a bus, at the very
least the bus should suffer Collateral Damage and it's pretty likely
you hit various people and nearby objects unless your target dwarfs
the bus in size.

GM's shouldn't slow the game down with checks for Collateral Damage
after every single attack; save it for when it would make a difference,
such as when the enemy is holding a hostage, or the battle is taking
place on top of something important that could explode or collapse.
Trivial damage, such as hot-dog stands getting knocked over, awnings
being busted or car alarms going off, can simply be narrated as a
result of the Primary Rule. Save actual checks for Collateral Damage
for times when somebody will care.

Use the result of the lower die from the roll as an attack against
whatever near-by targets seem appropriate according to the Primary
Rule; those targets then roll their appropriate defense or the Default
Skill if they have none. If you're rolling only one die, such as when
you are Hindered or taking a Wild Shot, if the GM calls for checking
Collateral Damage at that point roll the second die and use the result
even if it's higher than the original roll.

The GM should assign Toughness to objects based on how reasonable
it is for a character at that Scope to break the object; a rule-of-thumb
is Toughness equal to the Scope that the object would usually appear.
So a hot-dog stand would be Street Level (3), a car would be Neighborhood
level (4), and so on. An Out result from a Power at or lower than
the object's Scope will break the object and render it unusable until
repaired; it requires Out from a Power at least one Scope higher in
order to destroy the object, three higher if the the object is a building
or collection of buildings.

You can avoid the possibility of Collateral Damage by taking Careful
Aim.

#### Hindered {#sec:Hindered}

When you are Hindered all your Abilities except Automatic
Powers are reduced to a single (better) die. Hindered conditions accumulate
if you keep getting attacked successfully, and while your abilities
aren't further reduced it requires a separate Action to clear each
instance of Hindered. Automatic Powers aren't affected by being Hindered
unless they have the Can Be Hindered Disadvantage.

E.g., You're Hindered: your PL 8 Ability would roll a single d8 instead
of d8,d8, but your PL 7 Automatic Defense is unchanged, still rolling
d8,d6. If you're Hindered again on the same turn your Powers aren't
reduced further, but now you will need to spend *two* Actions
to "clear" the status. It might be helpful to give the player
a token, such as a poker-chip, each time the character is Hindered
to help keep track.

Being Hindered represents some specific thing that happened to the
character as a result of the successful attack that was insufficient
to put the character Out. It could be becoming trapped beneath the
thrown bus, having your hands webbed together, being groggy from sleep
gas, or just generically "stunned" by the force of the attack
if no more specific thing suggests itself. The GM will generally describe
what it is that's Hindering you, following from how the attack was
described; go with it. If it's really impossible that your character
be Hindered in the way described (the GM forgot that your character
doesn't need to breath, so gasping from smoke won't do) then suggest
something that does seem plausible to you. One way or another if the
attack was justified under the Primary Rule and the result was high
enough to Hinder you, you should be Hindered.

##### Becoming Unhindered {#sec:BecomingUnhindered}

In order to become Unhindered, you should describe what you're doing
according to the Primary Rule in order to get free of the Hindered
effect (this could just be shaking your head to clear the grogginess
if the conditions was as generic as just being "stunned", melting
your way out of webs, teleporting from beneath the rubble, and so
on); it is this that costs an Action. Players should be more generous
than usual in interpreting what is an appropriate description for
freeing yourself from being Hindered. Basically, being Hindered costs
you an Action, it's not intended to cost you the rest of your Turn
after you become Unhindered or debilitate the character for the rest
of the fight; the presumption should be that somehow or other you
can free yourself as long as you have Actions remaining. Using a Ability
in your description of how you free yourself from being Hindered doesn't
count as its single use for the Round. No matter how many Hindered
tokens you have stacked on you, you can always clear them all by sacrificing
your Turn (all your Actions) for the Round, or by sacrificing one
point of Will (see Sheer Determination).

##### Helping The Hindered {#sec:HelpingTheHindered}

You can use your Actions to help a hindered ally. If you spend a single
Action you remove all of the Ally's accumulated Hindered
conditions, provided that you have a Primary Rule explanation of how
exactly you're helping (e.g., burning them out of the webbing, lifting
the concrete off of them, or slapping their face and shouting "Pull
yourself together!"). This makes no real difference if your Ally
is only Hindered once (you spend the Action instead of them doing
it), but is substantially better if they have a lot of accumulated
Hindered conditions such as when the enemies have attacked them over
and over; as an ally you can clear off all the pesky agents with a
single Action, while the character herself would have to either do
it one by one, by sacrificing a Turn, or through Sheer Determination.

#### Out {#sec:Out}

Damage *in excess* of the defender's Toughness puts the defender
Out. (For attacks vs. Stamina see Tired, vs. Will see Influenced.)
Merely tying the Attribute does nothing extra, even against NPCs.
Out does not have to literally mean unconscious, merely incapable
of further combat until aided by another or given sufficient time
to recover or work free. A character who is tangled and helpless in
a web, fast asleep from gas, buried in cement, or locked in a force-bubble
counts as Out for game purposes; if you are aiming for a grittier
tone, Out can a heavy wound that incapacitates the character until
somebody (perhaps the character herself) provides medical aid. An
Out character is out of the fight until any of:

1.  Another character spends a full Round (all Actions) reviving the character
    or otherwise reversing the effect of the Out in accordance with the
    Primary Rule

2.  Another character spends an Action using a Shtick that by the Primary
    Rule is intended for situations such as this (e.g., Doctor, Medi-Kit)

3.  Three of your Turns have elapsed (during which you can either be presumed
    to be unconscious, or conscious but too busy tending to your wounds
    to even take time to communicate with your allies).

Example: Your ally was put Out by being teleported out of the battle.
To bring him back before three turns are up you would have to not
only spend a full Round, but come up with an explanation of how you
were using your Powers such using as your Movement Power (Super Speed,
Teleport) to retrieve him. If you had a Shtick that was specifically
designed for bringing him back into the fight, such as Teleport Ally
Shtick of your own, then you could do it with a single Action; note
that it has to be a Shtick, rather than a regular Power. (This serves
as a bonus for taking such specialized Shticks.)

Out characters may be further Restrained or put Down for the Count,
in which case they will not come back into action until those conditions
have been eliminated, even if one or more of the above are met.

Exactly how you are Out and what others would have to do to revive
you from being Out will depend on the description of the attack that
put you Out and the Primary Rule. For your part, there is nothing
you can do to hurry the process of reviving, but it is assumed that
after three of your Turns even if nobody has aided you as long as
the battle hasn't ended you will have found a way out of it, through
sheer force of will if nothing else. It's not at all unusual to be
Out, perhaps more than once, during the course of a battle. Getting
Out does not mean that you lose, unless you are the last character
standing, and perhaps not even then depending on whether the enemy
has the time and foresight to put you Down for the Count or flee;
if the enemy is otherwise occupied setting bombs, hijacking the airwaves
to deliver his demands or chasing off the police then you will be
back in action in three Turns. SF battles are full of reversals and
comebacks from near-certain defeat.

Regardless of the Primary Rule justification, Out must be reversible;
you are not allowed to define powers such that Out with the power
is permanent. Even if the Out character is magically turned to stone,
the result must be temporary. (Optionally in a gritty campaign, you
may agree that Overkill can make Out permanent, barring some extraordinary
plot event.)

##### Optional Rule: Injury[\[subsec:Injury\]]{#subsec:Injury label="subsec:Injury"}

Depending on the Tone for the campaign, serious, or at least long-lasting
injury may be more or less common. In some settings, wounds never
last past an episode, in others, characters may find themselves having
to deal with long-term effects of injury or even lose an eye or a
hand\...perhaps to replace it at a later date with a cyborg implant.

Upon returning from Out, whether you were helped or not, there is
a chance that you suffered a more serious injury. If the Primary Rule
reason you were out was such that it could have wounded you, rather
than just entangled you or put you to sleep, roll the unskilled Default
PL 2 (d2). On a roll of a 1, you are Tired, and gain a new Complication
to reflect the ongoing injury. For instance, you might decide that
your left hand is useless and in a sling. You may decide for yourself
whether the Complication is Major or Minor, depending on how it was
acquired. Like normal Complications you may substitute a new Complication
for this one when you choose to, say by replacing the hand with a
prosthetic. To remove the Complication completely you must spend a
Boost.

Equipment such as Armor and certain Powers allow you to mitigate the
chance of injury; you may substitute the Armor roll for your untrained
Default if you were wearing armor that could have mitigated the damage.
For instance if you were Out from a shot by a Blaster, then wearing
Trooper armor would let you roll a d6 instead of a d2, and only if
you rolled a 1 on the d6 would you suffer injury. On the other hand
if you were Out from a Psionic attack, the same Trooper armor wouldn't
be any use. If you have a Power or Shtick that's directly on point,
such as Regeneration, then you may substitute the Power's larger die
instead.

##### Restraining {#sec:Restraining}

You can automatically Counter an Out character recovering from being
Out by Restraining him. Restraining requires spending an Action with
an appropriate Primary Rule justification, such as tying the Out character
up, burying him under some rubble, etc.

A character that's being Restrained can't return to the battle without
outside help: another character will have to Hinder
or put the character who's Restraining him Out.

As long as you are continue to spend an Action every Round to Restrain
the character, nobody can bring him back from Out status, nor does
the three Turn limit apply. If you stop Restraining him, whether voluntarily,
or because somebody has put you Out or Hindered you, he is still Out
until one of the conditions for reviving him is met. The three Turn
count runs concurrently with being Restrained, so if three of his
Turns or more have passed while he was Restrained, he is no longer
Out and may act.

Whether minions and bystanders, individually or taken together as
a Mob, are capable of restraining a character who's been Out depends
on the character and the Primary Rule justification they're using.

##### Down For The Count {#sec:Down For The Count}

You can choose to spend an entire turn, all of your Actions and no
Movement allowed, putting an Out character Down For the Count. If
you are attacked during the turn, even if the attack fails, you do
not make progress putting him Down for the Count and have to try again.
You still need a Primary Rule justification for him being Down for
the Count, such as wrapping a steel I-beam around the character, cocooning
him in webbing from head to toe, or simply winding up a hay-maker
and knocking the living daylights out of him. Characters that are
Down for the Count are out of action until the end of combat, no matter
how many Rounds that takes, unless they are revived.

As with Restraining, you can't put a character Down For The Count
that you couldn't Hinder in the
first place: if the Power you're trying to use to put the Out character
Down For The Count is incapable of at least Hindering the character
(e.g. the maximum your Power can roll is 10 and the minimum their
Automatic Defense can roll is 11), then you need to use a Power with
a higher Power Level or Combine Powers with other characters.

In a gritty campaign, Down For the Count may mean dead.

Down for the Count is reversible, assuming the character is not dead
(and in some campaigns, even if the character is dead); bringing a
character back from Down For the Count requires the same effort (all
Actions) as putting a character Down For the Count, as well as a Primary
Rule justification, which might be harder to come by than normal.

##### Out Is Not Defeated {#sec:OutIsNotDefeated}

Note that being Out is *not* the same thing as being defeated.
The battle isn't over until you are Down For The Count or the enemy
has gotten away or otherwise accomplished his goal. Being Out is a
normal part of battles in SF adventures, which thrive on dramatic
reversals and come-from-behind victories, and Zap! tries to allow
for this. During a typical battle, several characters on either side
may get Out and come back before the final resolution.

#### Tired {#sec:Tired}

Damage in excess of the target's Stamina make the target Tired, as
do Tropes like
and , and suffering an Injury (see
). Like Hindered, while
you are Tired you only roll one die for your Abilities. Unlike Hindered,
being Tired doesn't accumulate: you are either Tired or you are not.
Tiredness does not stack with being Hindered, though you don't get
your full dice back until both conditions are cleared. You cease to
be Tired when:

1.  In combat: you spend three Rounds resting (not actively using any
    Abilities). Out of Combat: you spend a scene recovering (not doing
    anything except explicitly resting up)

2.  You or another character spend an Action using a Shtick that by the
    Primary Rule is intended for situations such as this (e.g., Healing,
    or Leadership)

3.  You trigger your Overdrive. E.g., if your Drive is to protect the
    innocent, then when an innocent is threatened, you can trigger Overdrive
    to recover from being Tired

#### Influenced[\[subsec:Influenced\]]{#subsec:Influenced label="subsec:Influenced"}

When you beat a target's Will, the Target is temporarily Influenced;
that doesn't literally mean the target is obeying your orders (though
it might if you're using a Power withe the Control Advantage) but
it means the target is temporarily bent to your will. If you were
firing your weapon at them trying to get them to take cover, they
take cover. If you were trying to Intimidate them into running, they
run. If you were trying to fast talk your way past the guards, they
let you through. They can still rally later, under much the same circumstances
as somebody recovering from being Out from an attack on Toughness,
e.g. Aid from an Ally with an appropriate Ability, or after 3 turns.

#### Overkill {#sec:Overkill}

When you do more than **3** points over a foe's Toughness, that's
Overkill. The exact result of Overkill will depend on the tone of
the campaign. Whether it occurs or not is entirely the GM's option,
and it might result in the foe being out for the remainder of combat,
a serious injury, or even death. Whether Overkill can ever result
in death is something that should be agreed upon by the group before
the rule is ever invoked to inflict it. Nothing can kill the fun of
a campaign faster than when a player suddenly finds that manslaughter
is possible, and she has committed it. You should always make sure
the players know if Overkill can result in death, and that they can
and should be using Careful Aim or Pulled Punches if they want to
be sure of avoiding it.

### Countering {#subsec:Countering}

When a character announces an Action they plan to do, other characters
may decide to Counter the Action. For example, if the Mad Genius is
about to press the self-destruct button for the base, your character
may want to tackle him before he can do so. Or you may want to stop
an alien beast from biting your friend by attracting its attention
to yourself.

When a character announces an Action that you wish to Counter, you
can spend one of your Actions and specify a Power, Shtick or the Default
Skill to use to try to prevent them from taking that Action. Whatever
they're attempting to do must now beat you in an Opposed Task first.
(Naturally you have to have Actions remaining and be using a Power
that you haven't already used this Round.) Combined Abilities and
other rules apply to this Opposed Task as normal. If he wins, he goes
ahead with his Action as planned and this contest doesn't count as
his one use of that Power for the turn; if he loses then he's out
the Power and the Action and his attempt failed.

If the character being Countered wishes, he can concede the contest
and re-use his Power and Action to do something completely different
instead; the Counterer will still have spent the Action and the Power.
E.g. you try to Counter the beast's attack on your friend by distracting
him with your Acrobatics, leaping and dancing about; the beast concedes
the contest, but turns and uses his Action and his Bite power to try
to chomp you instead; you've still spent your Action and used your
Power, so you'll need to defend with something else.

The character being Countered also has the option of trying to bring
a different power to bear to overcome your Countering; this will cost
him another Action and use another Power in addition to whatever he
was using for the attempt itself. Most of the time this will be because
he was using his Default Skill in the attempt, rather than a Power.
E.g. the Mad Genius was going to push the button, which would be an
ordinary task with his Default Skill since he has no particular "Button
Pushing" Power. If you attempt to Counter him using your Klangon
Strength, you'll almost certainly succeed; to prevent that he employs
his Mind Control Helmet to try to divert your strength. This costs
him an extra Action and uses his Power, but the Opposed Task is now
between his Mind Control Helmet and your Klangon Strength, which he
at least has a chance of winning. If he wins, he proceeds; if he loses,
he's out *both* Abilities and Actions.

An ally may attempt to oppose the counter for you. The classic example
is "covering fire": Ace Astra wants to run across the deck to
get to the emergency shut-off button on the docking bay force-field;
the enemy Troopers announce they are Countering by laying down heavy
suppressive fire with their Blaster Rifles vs. her (Default) running
ability; her ally Ford the bounty-hunter opposes the Countering by
firing *his* Blaster Rifle as covering fire. The Trooper's Counter
roll is now vs. Ford's Blaster Rifle ability.

Note that even if you use an attack power like Wrestling to Counter
an Action and succeed, the Countered character isn't Hindered or damaged
in any way. Your Wrestling hold lasted long enough that they couldn't
press the red button this turn, but does not continue to disrupt their
activities.

### Combining Actions {#sec:CombiningPowers}

You may Combine Actions to attack or defend, move, or accomplish other
tasks given appropriate descriptions according to the Primary Rule.
A Combined Action might be a super-strong character throwing another
character who attacks with his fists or blades ("Fastball Special")
or two martial artist coordinating their attacks ("You go high,
I'll go low") or one character grabbing a enemy to hold him long
enough for another to hit. A squad of riflemen might combine all their
shots into a single attack. When Combining Abilities the combo becomes
a single attack, and the Combined Power Level is equal to the Power
Level of one of the Combined Abilities of the attacker's
choice, plus 1 *Point* for each *character* Combining,
to a maximum plus equal to *the number of players in the fight*.
Thus, each player at the table involved in the fight can contribute,
if they choose, but you can never get a bigger plus than that. enemies
face the same limit: the number of *players*, not the number
of enemies. (Limiting the maximum to the number of players actually
involved in the fight means that characters aren't penalized for having
a big group of players who are off doing something else while the
enemies ambush them.)

The Advantages of the Combined Action will be those of the Ability
that's chosen as the base for the Action; you cannot mix and match
the Advantages of the different Abilities. Disadvantages are applied
separately. Using a Ability as part of Combining Abilities costs an
Action, even if it's an Automatic Power.

#### Combining Your Own Abilities {#sec:CombiningYourOwnPowers}

Characters may also combine two of their own Abilities, for a +1 as
per the standard rule, as long as they have a reasonable Primary Rule
justification, such as using flight to swoop down a enemy while swinging
an Electric Mace to add the speed of the dive to the impact of the
mace. Each Ability contributing takes one Action. You can't combine
more than **two** of your own Abilities, or Combine more than
two of your own Abilities and somebody else's Abilities.

### Disabling Abilities {#sec:DisablingPowers}

Besides attacking to Out, you can attack to Disable one of the opponent's
Abilities. The attacker rolls normally, following the Primary Rule,
and the defender rolls the Ability instead of whatever defense would
normally be applicable (so it's easier to Disable weaker Abilities).
A Hinder result means the Ability
is Disabled and cannot be used again until an Action is spent restoring
it; an Out result means the Ability is Disabled and can't be used
again until conditions similar to recovering from being Out are met:

1.  The character or another spends a full turn repairing or restoring
    the Ability using another Ability in accordance with the Primary Rule

2.  The character spends an Action using a Shtick that by the Primary
    Rule is intended specifically for situations such as this (e.g., Engineering,
    Regeneration)

3.  The character voluntarily leaves combat for **3** full Rounds
    to repair or restore the Ability

#### Disabling Automatic Defenses {#sec:Disabling Automatic Defenses}

When Automatic Defenses are Disabled, they don't completely go away:
instead they are reduced to a single die (as happens to Abilities
when Hindered), unless they have the Can be Disabled Disadvantage
or are targeted with Power that has the Disabling Only Advantage in
which case they behave as with any other Ability. In addition, Players
should take particular care that the Primary Rule justification for
Disabling a Automatic Defense makes good genre sense. E.g. if somebody
is made of stone, it ought to be pretty hard to justify reducing that
Power or taking it away, even temporarily.

### Splitting Abilities {#sec:SplittingAbilities}

The opposite of Combining Abilities is Splitting Abilities: you can
choose to attack multiple targets at once by dividing up your Power
into two dice, one at each target, or attempt two tasks at once by
dividing up your Shtick. You can't Split Abilities that have been
reduced to one die, such as when Hindered or Tired. As usual, you
need to follow the Primary Rule by having a plausible explanation
for what you're doing, whether it's firing one gun with either hand
at different targets, or kicking one guy while punching another. Even
if your explanation of how you're splitting your power involves multiple
shots, it still only counts as one Action. Similarly, you need a good
explanation of how you're using your Shtick in multiple ways at once,
such as trying to use your Thief Shtick to remain hidden in shadows
while picking the lock: one die would go towards the hiding in shadows,
the other towards picking the lock.

![image](airlock_scene.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

#### Optional Rule: Impromptu Area Effect

If you want to allow crazier stunts, such as stomping the ground so
hard it bowls over an entire squad, or running around at super speed
punching a dozen guys in the face, you can use the Impromptu Area
Effect Rule to break up the dice to cover even more targets. Attacking
two targets uses one die each. After that each time you lower the
die-size by one, you double the number of targets that die effects
(e.g., d8, d8 becomes 1d8 on each, then 1d6 on 2 targets and 1d6 on
another 2, then 1d4 on 4 targets and another 1d4 on a different 4
targets, etc.). You can never split a Power below d4, and you can
never "double up" by having the two groups overlap by a single
target; if that means that you cover less than the maximum (say there
are 4 in one group and only 3 left over for the second group), them's
the breaks.

Generally, Impromptu Area Effect is intended for when somebody is
spreading their Power around, such as setting your Maser on wide-angle
to try to shoot an entire crowd, or when the gigantic lizard sweeps
its tail through the entire party. If you're doing something like
shooting a hole in a nearby coolant pipe with your blaster to try
to engulf a mass of Empire Troopers, or tossing a tapestry down on
a group of guards charging up the stairs at you, it's quicker and
easier for the GM to treat that as creating a Peril or Obstacle instead.
(See .)

You can use the following table as a "cheat-sheet."

::: {#tab:SplittingPowers}
  \# Targets per die      1  2    4    8
  -------------------- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Die-size               -0  -1   -2   -3
                                      

  : Splitting Abilities
:::

##### And the rest\...

When you're using Impromptu Area Effect, after you've split the dice
to cover as many specific targets as you wish, you may choose to target
everybody left over in the area with a single d4. Roll 1d4 for all
of them, not each individual.

#### Quick Roll

When rolling for a bunch of identical Abilities, such as when NPCs
are defending against an Area Effect Power, or Power that's been split
among them with Impromptu Area Effect, instead of rolling for each
individual roll the defensive Power and treat the high die as applying
to half the group, and the low die as applying to the other half.

#### Speeding Combat Vs. Minions {#sec:SpeedingCombatVsMinions}

Against a bunch of identical foes, you can treat them as a Mob. To
treat them as a Mob just redefine them as a single entity, increasing
their Power Levels appropriately. See Mobs [6.1](#sec:Mobs){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:Mobs"}.

E.g., The Indescribable Bulk throws a truck at 16 agents of H.E.L.L.
As a Mob, you roll *once* for the Bulk at d12, d12 and then *once*
for the entire mob of Agents at, say PL 8 (d8, d8).

Generally, it makes more sense to treat opponents as a Mob if they
would be no threat to the character except *en mass*, or there
are too many to make it worth even counting how many individuals are
Hindered or Out.

### Duration Of Abilities {#sec:DurationOfPowers}

The duration of the effects of various Abilities should generally
be determined by the Primary Rule. If you make a patch of ice with
one of your Abilities, it will last until somebody else uses a Power
to get rid of it, or it melts naturally. If you make a wall of stone,
it will last until indefinitely, or until it's destroyed. On the other
hand, many Power effects should be presumed to last only until they're
overcome; if you Hinder a foe by trying to encase him in ice, the
icy coating only lasts until he spends an Action to free himself.

Tropes[\[sec:Tropes\]]{#sec:Tropes label="sec:Tropes"}
------------------------------------------------------

Tropes are special rules that help provide a better fit for things
that are typical of the genre. Tropes are almost always invoked by
the players, or the GM on behalf of the NPCs, so they can be used
as much or as little as the players see fit; they are not situational
modifiers, so you don't need to be constantly checking the list to
see if a particular Trope applies, nor is there any chance that you
played it "wrong" if you later realize that there was a Trope
that you might have used but didn't.

### Aid

Spend an Action to completely Unhinder an ally, no matter how many
Hindered conditions are stacked. You should still describe how you're
aiding the ally according to the Primary Rule.

### Careful Aim And Pulling Your Punch {#sec:CarefulAimAndPullingYourPunch}

There are times when the character may want to be more cautious about
using attacks, either to be surer that you hit, or to avoid doing
Collateral Damage or Overkill. If you take Careful Aim then instead
of rolling the dice you take half the die size of the larger die.
E.g., on d6, d6 you take 3, on d10, d8 you take 5. You won't have
the chance of rolling really well, but you won't roll really poorly
either. You cannot use this option while you are Hindered.

If you use Careful Aim, then you can choose not to do any Collateral
Damage if you wish. An exception is when you are attacking a bunch
of targets at once, either via a Power with the Area Effect advantage
or by Splitting the Dice; in that case, whether you can avoid Collateral
Damage through Careful Aim depends on the Primary Rule justification
you're using to explain how you manage to hit all the targets. For
instance, a character using Super Speed could say that he's just running
up to each target and punching them individually in the nose, so avoiding
Collateral Damage makes perfect sense; a character using Super Strength
who's justifying Splitting the Dice among a number of henchmen who
are standing within a crowd of bystanders by picking up a bus and
throwing it at them can take Careful Aim to make sure that he hits
them (doing half the die-size), but can't reasonably aim so as to
hit only the henchmen and not the people they're standing among; a
character with a Rain of Fire Power that has the Area Effect advantage
is similarly unable to avoid Collateral Damage simply by choosing
to use Careful Aim.

If you wish, you may also declare that you're Pulling Your Punch and
then you won't cause Overkill even if the result would normally be
sufficient to Overkill; you cannot Pull your Punch unless you are
taking Careful Aim. Again, Pulling Your Punch may require extra justification,
particularly if you're using an Area Effect attack.

Careful Aim and Pulling Punches cannot be combined with Wild Shot,
since the nature of Wild Shot is giving it everything you've got instead
of taking a safer more controlled shot.

### Failure Is Not An Option! {#sec:FailureIsNotAnOption}

If you are trying an Uncontested action and you roll poorly, you can
adjust the roll into the maximum roll by spending another Action and
invoking Failure Is Not An Option! You should accompany this with
some explanation of how you managed to pull it off. If you were in
combat, you become Hindered; this represents some extra time or effort
you needed to put in to change the failure to a success. If the adjustment
is more than your Stamina, you're Tired in addition.

If you're out of Actions, you may still invoke Failure Is Not An Option
but you automatically become tired, no matter how small the adjustment
was.

E.g., you are attempting to lift a car off the train tracks before
the oncoming train barrels into it, at Difficulty 6 for your Scope;
if you roll less than a 6, you can choose to still lift the car if
you wish, but you narrate that it almost slipped out of your grip
(the bad roll), and you had to lunge for it, as a result you're Hindered.

For extended tasks outside of combat where it doesn't make much sense
that you are temporarily Hindered, you may adjust still the roll to
the maximum, but if the adjustment is more than your Stamina you become
Tired; this represents working really hard at the task, such as might
be represented in a movie or comic book by a montage: exhaustive searches
at the library, late nights at the lab, pounding the streets talking
to contacts, and so on, until you succeeded.

You may never do this with Contested rolls; instead you would use
Supreme Effort. (see [4.8](#sec:SupremeEffort){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:SupremeEffort"})

Failure Is Not An Option may be combined with other ways of getting
bonuses to the roll, such as Combining Abilities and Supreme Effort,
with suitable Primary Rule explanation.

### Intimidation {#sec:Intimidation}

One staple of SF stories is the characters are often able to Intimidate
others through a display of their Abilities, particularly much weaker
foes such as normal people or low-level thugs. Attempts to Intimidate
are treated as attacks vs. Will, but instead of being a contested
roll against the Power that would normally be used to defend against
such an attack, the contest is vs. the defender's strongest Power.
This is the "You call that a knife? Now *this* is a knife!"
principle. Attempts to Intimidate don't literally require an attack
on the defender, merely a demonstration of what the Power is capable
of, such as against a nearby inanimate object. Creative use of the
Primary Rule can justify using Powers such as movement or defenses
in Intimidation, e.g. by using flight or telekinesis to dangle somebody
high above the ground, or to demonstrate that the target's best weapons
bounce harmlessly off your powered armor.

### Second Wind

If you are Tired, you can expend 1 point of Stamina to recover from
being Tired. You can only recover Stamina by spending a scene resting,
at one point per scene. A rest scene really should involve a restful
activity, like spending a night in a good bed, or bathing in a hot
spring, not just taking a brief pause in running from the wolves to
pant by the side of the road. In fiction, these are the scenes where
the protagonists let their hair, and their guards, down.

### Sheer Determination {#sec:SheerDetermination}

As a last resort, you can always free yourself from being Hindered
without spending any Actions by using Sheer Determination: regardless
of how many times Hindered has been stacked on you by previous attacks,
or what Abilities you have, you can clear them all by expending 1
point of Will. This does not take an Action, but once you reach 0
Will you can take one more Action and then are Out. Will can only
be recovered at the end of an adventure.

### Shoulder Roll

You can split your Power into one die on the attack, and one die on
the defense. E.g. You shoulder roll and come up firing your laser,
letting you split your Academy Training Power between attacking and
defending. Can be combined with automatic defense in the usual way
(treat as +1 to the smaller power).

### Supreme Effort {#sec:SupremeEffort}

If the Power isn't
sufficiently strong, but is close, you may attempt a Supreme Effort
to accomplish the task anyway. You add your Will Attribute to the
roll. E.g., d6, d6 Power plus Will 3 rolls 5, 2, which is a 5, then
+ 3 for the Supreme Effort = 8 total. If the roll is Uncontested you
may combine this with Failure is Not an Option (becoming Hindered
as well, to change your roll to the highest possible).

When you make a Supreme Effort, your Stamina goes down by one temporarily
(until the end of the adventure or you use Overdrive), and you become
Tired. Once you become Tired, you may not attempt further Supreme
Effort until you recover from being Tired.

You may apply Supreme Effort *after* you see what the die roll
is by spending an additional Action. This simulates the comic book
trope of realizing that you're about to fail and redoubling your effort,
even when that effort is something like firing eye-beams. If instead
you choose to apply Supreme Effort before the role it doesn't take
an extra Action, but might well be wasted (if the roll is so bad that
Supreme Effort can't possibly help, or so good that it was not needed).

### Take a Bullet {#subsec:TakeABullet}

When attempting to Counter an attack, the you can elect to "Take
a Bullet": you take the brunt of the Power against your Default
Skill, but the action is automatically Countered; the opponent doesn't
get to abort or attempt to use a different power to avoid being Countered.
Normals will sometimes do this to take an attack meant for another.

### This Ends Now! {#sec:ThisEndsNow}

Sometimes battles drag on forever, with neither side gaining a clear
advantage. To address this, either the players or the GM may suggest
at any point that the remainder of the battle be resolved via This
Ends Now! If you agree to resolve it via This Ends Now! Both sides
describe a single assault, which can use any of the rules for Combination,
Wild Swing, Supreme Effort, and Jury Rig and
the highest roll wins the battle decisively. The losers are at the
mercy of the winners, regardless of how the interplay of the Abilities
would normally be worked out according to the Primary Rule. (E.g.,
even if your Automatic Defense would usually make you immune to the
particular Power the enemies are employing, if you choose to use This
Ends Now!, if you lose, you lose and are Out/captured with the rest.)
Ties, as always, go to the players.

### Wild Shot {#sec:WildShot}

Any time you use a Power, you can take a "Wild Shot": you merge
the two dice into a single higher die. The result is generally a slightly
more erratic roll, but one with a chance of scoring larger hit (maximum
value increases). Wild Shot does not in itself require a special Primary
Rule justification, it just represents trying a harder, riskier shot.

Two identical dice merge into a single die one size larger: d8, d8
becomes a single d10; d10, d10 becomes d12, etc.

If dice don't match, roll just the larger die and add 1 to the result.
E.g., Power Level 7 is d8, d6. Using Wild Shot you change that to
d8+1.

#### Wild Shot And Combining Actions {#sec:GoWildAndCombiningActions}

Wild Shot may be done with Combined Actions as well. Just apply the
Combining Actions rule normally, and then merge the dice of the base
Ability.

**Example:** A squad of 4 goons, each with a PL 4 (d4, d4) attack
can Combine their Powers into a single (d4, d4)+4 attack; they have
the option of Wild Shot as well, transforming the attack into a d6+4
attack.

**Example:** A single character combines her own PL 8 Flight
and PL 10 Electric Mace attack and takes a Wild Shot. That's +1 PL
to one of the Abilities for the Combination, likely the Mace since
it's higher. That makes it (d10, d10)+1. Wild Shot would merge the
d10, d10 into a single d12, then +1 for Combining. Had her Mace been
PL 11, and Wild Shot would merge the d12, d10 into a single d12+1
and +1 for the Combination would have her rolling d12+2.

![image](SpaceMysteries9.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

Rounds And Turns {#sec:RoundsAndTurns}
----------------

The players and the NPCs take Turns, going around the table, alternating
between the GM and each player. Once around the table is called a
Round.

Your character's Actions attribute determines the maximum number of
Actions you can take in a Round, and all Abilities except defenses
may only be used once per Round. This may not be strictly realistic
when one character is an android capable of sorting an entire library
of data chips in a matter of minutes and another is merely human in
command of the ship, but science fiction stories don't feature 5 minutes
of scenes with the android in the engineering section for every 10
seconds of the captain on the bridge.

The GM begins each Round by describing the locale as it currently
stands, and particularly any conditions that have changed as a result
of previous Rounds, such as radioactive goo spreading across the floor
from the storage tank that was just ruptured, bus-loads of orphans
now careening out of control, countdown timers on doomsday devices
advancing, and so on. Play should then alternate between a player
taking a Turn and then the GM taking the Turn of one or more NPCs,
until every PC and NPC has taken a Turn. The GM should try to space
out the Turns of the NPCs so they go in between each player's Turn,
instead of all the NPCs at once.

#### On Your Turn {#sec:OnYourTurn}

On your Turn, you can do **as many different things as
your** Actions, as long as you don't use any Ability more than once.
Sequences of Actions have to make sense as happening rapidly according
to the Primary Rule; you shouldn't try to reprogram a computer, wrestle
an alligator, and seduce the enemy all at the same time, even if each
of those makes sense individually and you have enough Actions to cover
it.

If your Turn comes around and you don't want to do anything yet, you
can postpone your Turn for later; play then moves on to the next player.
You may take your Turn later, but you may not interrupt another character's
Turn except to try to Counter them.

You may invite other Players to join you in Combined Actions (or they
may suggest it); if they join you, you are considered to be taking
your Turns simultaneously and they do not get a separate Turn later.
If you use multiple Actions to attack the same foe, you can treat
them as a sequence of separate attacks or as a Combined Action, depending
on how you describe them.

#### Not Your Turn {#sec:NotYourTurn}

As long as you have Actions left:

-   If it's somebody else's Turn, you can defend yourself or others, Combine
    your Abilities with others to help them, or attempt to Counter an
    Action.

-   In between Turns you can take any Action that doesn't involve attacking.

#### Cutting in Line {#subsec:CuttingInLine}

If you have some reason you want to take your Turn in the order before
one of other players goes that Round, you can just ask them to take
your turn first. Your position at the table isn't meant to be destiny;
it's just an easy way to keep track of who hasn't had a chance yet.
If you want to cut before an NPC, you can spend an *extra* Action
to move your Turn up.

#### Interrupting {#sec:Interrupting}

You can only Interrupt somebody else's Turn once they've announced
it if you are trying to Counter them, otherwise you should wait until
their Turn is resolved.

Don't spend too much time thinking about the best order to carry out
Actions or take Turns--the object is to keep the action flowing,
cutting back and forth between the characters and the enemies as in
a movie, rather than to gain any kind of tactical advantage.

Special Situations {#sec:SpecialSituations}
------------------

The variety of Abilities and situations that science fiction characters
confront, and all the ways they can combine, is vast. Most of the
time, dealing with this in Zap! is straightforward: you apply the
Primary Rule to see what sounds sensible in an SF story and then either
it simply happens (if it's unopposed and well within the Ability's
capabilities), you roll and compare to a Difficulty (if it's unopposed
but possibly beyond the limits of the Ability), or you roll against
the opposing Ability.

Nevertheless, some special situations crop up frequently enough that
it's worth treating them slightly differently, both for greater fidelity
to the genre and more consistency when they crop up. They are largely
elaborations on the basic procedure, rather than replacements for
it, and the GM should feel free to ignore them in any situations where
they would make less sense than the basic procedure.

### Mobs {#sec:Mobs}

SF characters frequently confront mobs, even armies, of lesser foes.
While the ordinary rules for combining Abilities (when it comes to
the mob attacking) and splitting Abilities (when the characters attack
the mob) are sufficient for small groups, it can become tedious if
the mob is very large or is interacting with multiple characters at
once. In these situations, it's convenient to handle the mob as a
single entity, or perhaps one entity per character. Simply stat the
mob out as if it were a enemy, with Abilities and Attributes representing
the combined values of the individual members; there is no need to
calculate this according to the rules for Combining Abilities, just
do it directly based on the Scope. E.g., a mob of ordinary citizens
sufficient to take on a Neighborhood-level character can just be given
a Main Power (guns and improvised weapons) at Level 6 (d6, d6), a
Automatic Defense (multiple bodies) at Level 8 (d8, d8), Toughness
3, Will, Stamina and Actions 2, and then fight as a single entity.
Out can represent the mob being dispersed, rather than each individual
being incapacitated (though it could represent that, too, depending
on the Primary Rule). When fighting a mob as a single entity, there
is no need for characters to split their Abilities or use Area Effect
Abilities to cover the entire mob, whether making an ordinary attack
or Intimidation; the presumption is that the coordination or tight
packing that allows the mob to be treated as a single entity for purposes
of overwhelming the characters render it vulnerable to disruption
or scattering without special effort on the part of the characters
so long as the basics of the Primary Rule are followed.

Mobs are treated the same as single characters when it comes to rules
like Wild Shot, Supreme Effort, and the like, whether the mob is fighting
a single character or another mob. Mobs may Combine Actions with characters,
provided they are operating at the same Scope. That is, a single minion
shouldn't be able to combine with the enemy leader to give him a bonus,
but a mob of minions large enough to be a threat to the character
should.

### Hit Locations {#sec:HitLocations}

Most of the time the exact location a blow
or shot hits can be determined according to the Primary Rule, or just
by picking a likely location. Sometimes you might want a way to resolve
where it lands in an impartial fashion: perhaps the attack does something
additional if it hits unarmored skin, or perhaps you just find it
easier if you don't have to make it up on the fly. Chart 15.1 can
be used to pick a location without any additional roll. Just use the
least-significant digit of the lower of the two dice rolled. The smaller
the die, the larger the area the number represents: on a d4, a 3 would
be anywhere on the arm or hand; on a d6 a 3 would be on the forearm
or hand.

![Hit Location](Damage Chart.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

If the player wants to call a shot to a particular location, the least
significant digit of the lower die (including any bonuses) has to
meet or beat the number on the hit location chart. Whether that hit
Hinders or puts the target Out still depends on the Damage when compared
to the defender's roll.

### Crossing Scopes {#sec:CrossingScopes}

Adventurers sometimes face opponents of different Scopes from their
own, whether it's lower-level alien critters or menaces from a higher
Scope. Since within a Scope Power levels always have the same range
from PL 2 to PL 12 (roughly), when encountering something from another
Scope you have to translate its Scope to your own. You should almost
always translate them into your Scope, so you don't have to do the
math on all the players' Abilities. To do that:

-   For each Scope Level the opponent is *higher*, add 1 to its Power
    Level for PLs less than 6, add 2 to its PL for PLs greater than or
    equal to 6.

-   For each Scope Level the opponent is *lower*, subtract 2 from
    its Power Level for PLs greater than or equal to 6, subtract 1 from
    its Power Level for PLs less than 6.

Examples:

Facing a foe 2 Scope Levels lower (such as Street Scope when you are
City) who has a PL 7 Power : Street Level 7 = Neighborhood Level 5
= City Level 4. The first jump in Scope subtracts 2, the second only
1, since at that point it's already at less than 6. His Power will
be treated as PL 4 when facing you.

Facing a foe 3 Scope Levels higher (such as Regional Level when you
are Street) who has a PL 7 Power: Regional 7 = City 9 = Neighborhood
11 = Street 13. Each downward jump add 2 levels. His PL 7 Power will
be treated as PL 13 (d8+5, d12) while at your Scope.

Facing a foe 3 Scope Levels higher who has a PL 4 Power: Regional
4 = City 5 = Neighborhood 6 = Street 8. The first two downward jumps
add only 1, since the PL is less than 6, then the last adds 2. His
Power at your Scope is PL 8.

If you look at the Power Level charts in the Appendix you'll see this
is a reasonably good approximation of looking up what a Power at a
given Scope ought to be able to do and then cross-indexing to what
the equivalent is on the Scope chart for the appropriate lower or
higher Scope.

### Inventing Features of the Environment, How Much is Too Much?

Zap! leaves the players a good deal of room to just make up features
of the environment as needed to employ their Abilities. If they're
in a docking bay and they want to hurl a barrel at an oncoming trooper,
they can assume there's a barrel because that seems plausible. Nothing
is really gained by forcing them to stop and ask the GM whether there
is a barrel, and if not is there something similar enough that it
would work within reach? On the other hand, it would be very dull
if the players could just declare "I pick up the secret documents
we're supposed to be searching for from where they were left in the
open on the desk." Similarly, if the characters are in a starport
bar, the players can just assume that there are bartenders and patrons
such as a loud drunk, a prosperous-looking businessman (unless perhaps
it was a very seedy bar), a tough-looking stevedore, and so on\...
but what about the President of the Federation, who just happens to
be there? Where to draw the line?

The rule of thumb is that players should refrain from inventing anything
that would demand further explanation. If you were watching an SF
show and there were barrels in the docking bay, it would never occur
to you to wonder why they were there, but if the heroes stumbled across
the secret plans just lying on a receptionist's desk it would raise
all kinds of questions. Players should try to never just make something
up that makes the other players stop and wonder how or why it's there.

Even if something were perfectly plausible, the players shouldn't
invent it on their own if it would raise questions about why nobody
noticed it before. You don't want to have your narration cause all
the other players to have to completely revise their mental image
of the scene. A bar-fight may be a perfectly normal occurence, at
least in the kind of bar PC's frequent\... but a player ought not declare
that her character is using the distraction caused by the heretofore
unmentioned bar-fight going on to pick somebody's pocket since that
would raise the question of why nobody noticed it until now. Better
to instigate a fight, and *then* use it as a distraction.

Range {#sec:Range}
-----

Range and positioning in Zap! are highly abstract, and are scaled
according to the Personal Scope of the Campaign. Rather than giving
a range as a concrete number such as 300 meters, and then calculating
that based on a movement rate of 100 meters per Round it will take
three Rounds to cover the distance, in Zap! you would say that since
the Scope is e.g., Neighborhood, the enemy being on the next street
over puts him at Pursuit Range, and it will take one round using your
Movement Power to reduce that to Combat Range. Almost all combat takes
place at Combat Range for the Scope, except perhaps at the beginning
when the sides are just catching sight of each other, or if one side
is trying to elude the other.

Range divides into Combat Range, Pursuit Range, and Lost Contact with
the distances depending on the Scope. Combat Ranges for each Scope
are listed below; Pursuit Range is one Scope level higher, and Lost
Contact is two Scope levels higher. So a character operating at City
Scope would treat everything in a single block of buildings as within
Combat Range, up to a couple blocks away in any direction as being
Pursuit Range, anything farther away would be Lost Contact. Note that
Pursuit Range doesn't literally mean they are directly visible at
all times, or that you have noticed them, merely that the Scope of
your senses and movement Abilities are sufficient that you can attempt
to locate them; depending on the Primary Rule that may mean you are
criss-crossing the area at Super Speed rather than searching for them
with X-Ray vision, but in any case they must win one more Contested
Movement roll before they've eluded you completely.

![image](SpaceAdventures21.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

At Combat Range all Abilities work normally; at Pursuit Range, the
you can only roll a Contest of either movement vs. movement or sensory
Abilities versus hiding or evasion; if you've Lost Contact, you can't
even try to locate the target any more---you have no idea which direction
they've gone or how far. What constitutes Combat Range does *not*
depend on the Power in question: claws and laser-beam eyes have the
exact same Combat Range for a given Scope, they simply require different
descriptions of how the power is used to justify them, with claws
more likely to require extra justification by including a description
of how the character runs and leaps on the foe, or slashes a cable
holding a cargo net to make it fall on him. In any case, by the Primary
Rule if you can't come up with a plausible justification given the
circumstances, you should refrain from using the power until it is
justified.

Each Round you can try to reduce or increase the Range by one category;
if the other side tries to prevent that from happening (by fleeing
or pursuing) make a Contested roll of Movement and sensory Abilities
vs. Movement and stealth Abilities, depending on whether the quarry
is trying to outdistance pursuit or hide; this takes an Action.

Ranges are symmetric: no character can attack another from a range
too great for the target to counter-attack. It may be that the description
of certain Abilities implies a limitation on the range of that Power,
e.g., a Sword implies that you generally have to be within arm's length
of the target. Even so, if the character chooses to throw the sword,
or move to close with the foe and smack him one, the range to the
foe is no different from any other Power.

The Combat Range also determines the Difficulty of spotting a target
with a sensory power, e.g. something that would require special senses
to spot would ordinarily be Difficulty 6 , but for a Neighborhood
Scope character to spot it several blocks away would be +2 Scope levels,
therefor Difficulty 8. (see Difficulty for Other Tasks[3.1.3](#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks){reference-type="ref" reference="subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks"}.)

### Movement And Range {#sec:MovementAndRange}

Most Adventurers, except at the very lowest Personal Scopes, are capable
of traveling much faster than would ever be necessary to get about
in combat or reach any place within Combat Range within a relatively
short amount of time. You can use the Power Level chart to figure
out how fast your character can go, but most of the time the character
is going to be more constrained by the need to justify the movement
by the Primary Rule than the actual speed. Characters in Zap! are
presumed to be within reach of each others' Abilities as long as they're
at Combat Range or less, as long as they describe what they're doing
adequately. Movement is only separate action when you're attempting
to change the Range or overcome an Obstacle, otherwise it takes place
as part of the description of the other actions the character is taking.

For instance, if your Movement Power is Super Speed, and the enemy
is flying, how do you get up to him if that's what you want to do?
Can you run so fast that you can run straight up a near-by building?
Or spin so fast with your arms outstretched that you helicopter into
the air? Or do you need to find or build a ramp at super-speed and
launch yourself off it? In real-world physics there is no speed that
makes any of those except the last possible, but in comic-book physics
any could be an explanation if that's how you say your Power works,
pretty much regardless of the exact level of the Power and where it
falls on the speed chart.

Once in a while the situation might make it hard to justify using
the Power: if the enemy is standing at the other side of a lava-filled
crevasse and the character's Movement power is roller-skating the
player might feel it's implausible that the character could jump the
crevasse to touch the enemy with her stun glove; according to the
Primary Rule she should simply do something else, or combine her attack
with another character who can supply the needed justification by
carrying her over to attack with his Rocket Pack power. In general,
though, given the flexibility of Abilities and the leeway given to
the players to invent plausible details of the environment such as
vines to swing on, news copters to hitch a temporary ride from, rubble
that's formed a convenient ramp to jump a motorcycle from, and so
on, players should rarely find themselves at a loss for justifying
closing any distance within Combat Range even if the Power's description
requires they actually touch their opponent.

### Senses And Range {#sec:SensesAndRange}

Difficulty for spotting something with your senses is relative to
how hard it would be to spot, adjusted by distance according to the
area that the particular Combat Range covers. By the Primary Rule,
though, you should only have to roll if what you're trying to spot
might easily be missed, such as when it's concealed or you're distracted.
If it's actively trying to hide, that would be an Opposed check vs.
whatever Ability it was using to conceal itself.

E.g., Something that an ordinary human could spot would be Difficulty
4, something only perceptible to super-senses or equivalent instruments
would be difficulty 6, and so on. (See Difficulty for Other Tasks
[3.1.3](#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks){reference-type="ref" reference="subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks"}). If an ordinary human could
spot it when within the same large room (Scope 2), then spotting it
from the next block over (Scope 5) would be +3 to the difficulty,
or Difficulty 7. On the other hand, spotting it from within the area
covered by small room would be -1 to the difficulty, for a Difficulty
of 3.

The amount that you make the roll by can be used to indicate how much
information your senses reveal. Succeeding by 0 means you can perceive
what's currently happening, which is usually sufficient, but many
unusual senses that Adventurers might possess could plausibly be able
to reconstruct past events or perceive minute or subtle details. See
Investigation Results.

Investigation {#sec:Investigation}
-------------

Frequently in Science Fiction, the characters will be facing the unknown.
It could be as prosaic as trying to solve a crime, or as exotic as
trying to determine why the laws of physics themselves seem to be
breaking down, but Investigation will form a large part of most SF
adventures, and the players will want to play out obtaining new information.
Most of the time in Zap!, the information is there for the asking,
while the interpretation is left up to the players. If they search
a body, or a database, or perform a scientific experiment, they will
find everything that the GM thinks is a relevant clue, and perhaps
some red herrings besides.

In other cases, the players will want their characters to perform
investigations and detective work in order to outsmart or get the
jump on the enemies, for instance to figure out their enemy's likely
next move or sniff out the security precautions he's placed in his
lair, in which case the character should roll the appropriate Ability
(usually a Shtick) or the Default Skill if using something from the
character's Background against the Difficulty of
the task (see Difficulty for Other Tasks [3.1.3](#subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks){reference-type="ref" reference="subsec:DifficultyForOtherTasks"}),
and comparing the result to the following table:

The number of you beat the Difficulty by determines the amount of
information obtained:

   Success  Answer
  --------- -------------------------------------------
      0     yes/no
      1     one-word answer
      2     short sentence, quantity, or direction
      3     diagram or paragraph description
      4     sketch or series of questions
      5     clear image or a conversation with the GM

  : Information Gained

You can Combine Actions for Abilities that give information, with
yourself and others, and that usually is an excellent strategy since
each additional success more than doubles the amount of information
you get. (One roll at +1 is better than two characters making rolls.)

Note that how much information you get is determined by the roll,
but which information you get is determined by how you narrate your
actions and phrase questions to the GM.

The result is approximately how much information the GM should divulge.
For instance if the detective is trying to deduce what the criminal's
target is as they are attacking a museum exhibition, that's something
that an ordinary person could do (Difficulty 4), so the detective
rolls her appropriate Ability vs. Difficulty 4. Suppose she gets a
6; she beat it by 2 and the GM should provide about one sentence worth
of information: "The most likely target is the special exhibition
of gold insects on the second floor." If she had beat it by 5, then
the result would be a picture; not necessarily a literal picture,
but the information equivalent to looking at a photo of what they
intend to steal, which means that she could ask questions if she wanted
such as what kind of display case it's in, whether there are guards
around and so forth and the GM should try to answer if it would be
evident from looking at such a photo.

When the GM is conveying the results of the Investigation roll, it's
best if at all possible to give the actual clues that the detective
spotted that lead to the conclusion couched in terms that make sense
according to exactly what Ability or skill the detective is employing
rather than the bare bones of the information. If a mystic character
is using her Psychic Sensitivity to try to identify a suspect, then
the description should be in terms of psychic impressions, and perhaps
lean more heavily towards the feelings and psychology of the target;
a character using Detective should be given more concrete physical
description along the lines of "From the angle of the blow it would
have to be somebody taller than the victim, and quite strong, either
a man or strong woman; the attacker was left-handed, and some from
some thread that were caught on one of the victim's buttons was wearing
a very expensive cashmere jacket." The goal, as always with Zap!,
is to make the descriptions flow satisfyingly from the Primary Rule
being applied to the specific Ability used.

### A Note On Investigation {#sec:ANoteOnInvestigation}

Don't overuse Investigation; in particular don't turn it into the
skill system that Zap! doesn't have. Nothing of value is added to
the game by substituting Investigation rolls for the Spot and Notice
checks that some other games have. If it's something that the character
should notice or know because of their Abilities or Background,
the GM should just divulge the information. Characters in SF don't
usually miss clues, even really obscure ones, and the flow of the
game isn't helped by the players having to play twenty questions to
see if they notice something relevant. SF characters in particular
often have abilities far beyond those of mortal men, and even senses
that nobody has or can accurately describe. Just go ahead and tell
them all the information they can glean, using whatever senses and
abilities they have, and let them get on with the far more interesting
part of interpreting and using that information. Reserve Investigation
for when it's an activity that will be interesting enough to devote
play time to, preferably when the players instigate it, for instance
by announcing they're going to use their ship's computer to try to
analyze the signal from the surface of the planet and identify the
culture that likely produced it.

It can take some work for GMs used to other systems to shake the habit
of asking the players to roll to see if anybody knows a certain piece
of information or notices the impending ambush, but it will make for
a faster-paced game and help the characters really shine. A good rule
of thumb is never use an Investigation roll for something that the
character would passively notice or could see at a glance, and if
the player announces the character is going to perform a specific
activity to try to gather information such as visit the dives around
the starport to shake down punks for information, or research at the
university library, consider whether the Primary Rule implies they
should just be given the information they're seeking (if it is indeed
a plausible way to turn it up) without requiring a roll. Reserve rolling
for situations where it's unclear whether and how much information
they should turn up.

Negotiations
------------

Negotiations are a catch-all for all inter-personal interaction that
is not overtly hostile. Usually, you want something from someone else,
and are trying to convince them to give it to you, whether you want
a possession, information, or simply for them not to help your enemies.

Negotiations are broken down into three types of sub-goals:

When using a Shtick in negotiations, set the difficulty level to be
the Scope of the person or group you are negotiating with (for a person
that's usually the size of the area they command, e.g. the Mayor of
a City would be 5, since City is Scope 5).

The GM will determine the most likely attitude at the start of the
Scene based on your common history, alignment of interests, characters,
and the role-played interaction. You can make a roll to Charm or Appease.
Success improves their attitude by one level just during the scene;
success by more than their Will makes the attitude one level higher
permanently, or at least until you do something further that alters
it for the worse; if you succeed by **3** more than their Will,
their attitude becomes *two* levels higher. If you *fail*
by more than **3**, their attitude becomes one level *worse*.
You may not attempt to Charm/Appease them more than once per Scene,
nor have different characters try one after another, although you
may all Combine your abilities; once you've determined their basic
attitude towards you for the scene and done your best to modify it,
play out the rest of the scene and any attempts to Convince or Entice/Caution
them based on the resulting attitude.

The numbers for each attitude are modifiers to your rolls to Convince
or Entice/Caution them, once you've determined their attitude.

![image](dressing_down_by_jamused-d3jgdwr.png){width="100%"}

The GM will rate their receptiveness to an idea, based on their nature
and the role-played encounter. Using an Ability to Convince them or
Entice/Caution them can increase this one level with a success, or
two levels if you succeed by more than their Will; failure by more
than **3** makes this one level worse.

      Convince     Entice/Caution
  --- ------------ ----------------
   1  Denial       Repugnance
   2  Disbelief    Reluctance
   3  Skepticism   Disinterest
   4  Neutrality   Neutrality
   5  Openness     Interest
   6  Belief       Eagerness
   7  Conviction   Zealousness

#### What an Ally will give you

It is generally cheap for a party to give you information they have,
so any favorable attitude might give you information. Secondly, the
other group may give you assistance. This will often be in the form
of assigning an underling to help you, or a temporary Ability. They
could also take charge of some aspect of a group plan, such as keeping
the Imperial Troopers busy while you corner the General. Finally,
if they are really committed to helping you, they could devote their
entire resources to your joint endeavor. Usually, they would take
charge of the major aspects and risks, and delegate some smaller role
to you.

The Environment {#sec:TheEnvironment}
---------------

In science fiction stories the environment provides things for Adventurers
to break or use as weapons against each other, and things that are
dangerous to the characters. Other aspects of the environment merely
provide fodder for using the Primary Rule and plot and characterization
for the adventures.

### Environment Description {#sec:EnvironmentDescription}

The GM should take care to describe the environment in sufficient
detail to provide the players with a good sense of the ways that they
can employ the Primary Rule when taking their actions. It's not necessary
to be obsessively detailed, and a battle mat and miniatures are almost
certainly overkill (though if you want to and have the action figures
lying around, go for it), but a bit of extra time fleshing out the
scene slightly is well worth it. Don't just say "When you blast
through the door, you see a hi-tech lab and a bunch of technicians."
If you can, add some salient details: Along the right side of the
room are a bunch of bubbling tanks with shadowy figures suspended
in them; a myriad of tubes criss-cross the ceiling and descend into
the tanks. In the middle of the room a group of about seven scientists
in lab coats and goggles are working at some tables with Bunsen burners,
various chemical glassware, and microscopes. Along the left side of
the room is a bank of computers and monitors, and three agents in
armored jump-suits, with bandoleers and sidearms are working on them.
At the rear of the room, on a raised platform that takes up the entire
back of the room, there is some sort of metallic table with restraints
and three huge ominous ray devices pointing at it. Light is coming
from standard panels in the ceiling, like the rest of the base, and
there is another closed Blast Door at the far end past the platform.

Players are free to assume that there are features that aren't explicitly
mentioned, as long as they make sense given what they're told is there,
but they should exercise some restraint when it comes to unusual,
too convenient, or bizarre features. A mad scientist's biology lab
certainly has glassware, might have rats or even monkeys in cages,
but almost certainly doesn't have a pool full of hippopotamuses unless
the GM has mentioned it or it's somehow in keeping with the enemy's
persona.

### Buildings {#sec:Buildings}

Buildings are similar to Bases, but will usually lack any Abilities
except a Automatic Defense and Toughness, which will start at PL 6
and the Scope Level respectively, but can be higher for special-purpose
or hardened buildings such as prisons or armories. As with Vehicles,
merely getting an Out on a Building with a Power on the same Scope
as the building doesn't destroy it\...it breaches the building's security
and perhaps a wall. To be able to destroy a building in a single blast
requires scoring an Out with a Power **3 levels** higher in Scope.
E.g., it takes a Power on the Cosmic scale to potentially destroy
the whole world in a shot, or Power on a National scale such as a
fighter jet to destroy an entire sky-scraper. You can destroy a building
with lesser Power, if you keep applying it, such as a tank destroying
a large sky scraper, but it's up to the Primary Rule to determine
how long it takes or if it can be done at all\...after all a single
M1 Abrams tank can't expect to destroy an entire city by itself in
any reasonable amount of time.

#### Building Levels {#sec:BuildingLevels}

Buildings all start with an Automatic Defense of PL 6 (d6, d6) and
a Toughness equal to their level.

### More Stuff To Break {#sec:MoreStuffToBreak}

The world is full of stuff for adventurers to break. Most of the time
this can be handled by simple application of the Primary Rule, particularly
when the character is setting out to break it. If a Street Level character
wants to smash through an ordinary interior door using his Abilities,
the door should smash. Sometimes, though, it's questionable whether
the character has sufficient power, such as when a Street Level character
wants to smash through a bank vault door. Power Level 6 is enough
to lift a motorcycle, but to break open a bank vault?

As mentioned in the Collateral Damage rules, random objects generally
have Toughness equal to the minimum Scope at which a number of them
tend to appear, and the Default Skill (PL 4) for resisting attacks.
Hot Dog stands and fire hydrants are Street Level (3), News stands
and cars are Neighborhood Level (4), and so on. Attacks at the same
or lesser Scope will break the object on an Out result, but not destroy
it; and destroy it on Overkill. Attacks from a higher Scope character
will destroy an object with an Out, though it takes **three**
levels higher to destroy a building or similarly huge object (or collection
of objects, such as a city block or office park).

Particularly tough objects, such as bank vaults, should be given the
benefit of the three levels rule as if they were buildings, and possibly
an actual Automatic Defense; realistically a bank vault would probably
survive the complete destruction of the bank, so it would be somewhat
implausible for a enemy who couldn't destroy the building to be able
to smash the vault in a single blow.

### Perils and Obstacles {#sec:PerilsAndObstacles}

The world is full of dangerous things that can injure or inconvenience
the unwary character: rivers of bubbling lava, perilous crumbling
cliffs, tanks containing sharks with frickin' laser beams on their
foreheads, and other perils too numerous to mention. Perils are treated
as Automatic Attack Powers. Obstacles are treated as Automatic Powers
that attempt to Counter certain actions, most often movement or senses.
A patch of oil that attempted to Counter any movement across it would
be a Obstacle; a patch of oil that was on fire would be a Peril, and
perhaps an Obstacle to sight.

The GM should assign a Power Level based on a combination of how difficult
to avoid or how deadly or effective it is. A rivulet of lava only
2 feet across will probably have a lower Power Level than a cloud
of sleep gas that completely fills the room. A patch of loose gravel
that made running difficult would have a lower Power Level than an
oil slick, even if it covered a much larger area. When the characters
interact with the Peril, such as when a room is filled with sleep
gas or if dumped in among the sharks, treat is as an attack against
their defense. The Peril should act against the character once per
Round, generally on the character's Turn to make it easier to track.

When characters interact with a Obstacle, the Obstacle should attempt
to Counter their actions whenever they narrate something that would
interact with it, such as riding their motorcycle across the oil slick;
treat it as a normal attempt to Counter, where they have the usual
options of aborting to save their Power and Action, rolling against
it to see if they succeed anyway, or spending an Action to use some
other Power to counter it (such as shooting a nearby sandbag to spill
sand across the oil slick before trying to ride over it).

Perils are often non-lethal. Non-lethal Perils can still potentially
put characters Out, either by actually knocking them out, or by removing
them from combat for three Turns. E.g., if a dam bursts and inundates
the character, scoring an Out against the appropriate defense could
represent the character being washed away down river and needing three
Turns to return rather than being unconscious. If something can't
reasonably put a character Out, only inconvenience them or block their
actions, treat it as a Obstacle instead. Slippery floors, or clouds
of obscuring gas are almost always Obstacles, not Perils.

Some things might be treated as both: a river of lava might be a Obstacle
if you attempt to cross it, and a Peril if you fail and fall in. Use
the Primary Rule to decide which, given the circumstances. Such things
should typically have different Power Levels as a Peril or a Obstacle:
being extremely deadly does not automatically make something nearly
impossible to avoid or overcome, and vice versa.

![image](sinking_by_jamused-d48e0ip.png){width="7.5in"}

Perils and Obstacles should never use Wild Shot, or exert Supreme
Effort, but simultaneous perils might Combine Actions, and clever
characters might try to combine their Power with them. If the ceiling
of the secret lair is caving in at the same time that the character
is trying to leap to safety over the bubbling lava, treat it as a
Combined Obstacle acting to Counter his leap. This works out slightly
to the character's favor, but speeds things along.

Note that since Perils count as Automatic Attacks there's no limit
to how many times they can attack in a Round as long as the conditions
that trigger the attack are met. The Peril will only attack a given
character on its "own initiative" once per Round, but other characters
can try to incorporate the Peril into a Combined Attack as many times
as they like, provided they can justify it by the Primary Rule. For
instance, you might combine Martial Arts with the room filled with
sleep gas by saying you were punching the foe in the gut to force
him to breathe some in. Remember that combining attacks with Automatic
Powers such as Perils always use the lesser Power as the base, and
add to that. E.g. Martial Arts PL 8 and Sleep Gas PL 6 would combine
to a PL 6+1 attack not a PL 8+1\...but since the Sleep Gas is the base,
if it had any advantages like vs. Stamina those would apply to the
combined attack, just as the martial artist intended.

Perils and Obstacles might behave as if they had certain Advantages
and Disadvantages, such as being Area Affect, or Exotic, or Single
Use, just as if they were a normal Power.

If the character tries to eliminate the Peril or Obstacle, say by
freezing the lava in place, treat that as an attack to Disable the
Power. It's possible that a Peril or a Obstacle is so dangerous or
permanent it can't be eliminated, for instance a sea of lava in a
Neighborhood campaign; in that case don't even assign it a number,
just say it's beyond the character's abilities. The GM should assign
a Toughness based on how easy it is to eliminate the Peril or Obstacle.

Like all Abilities, Perils and Obstacles follow the Primary Rule.
It doesn't matter that the river of lava is defined as a Obstacle,
if the character has flight she can just fly over it without having
to roll her Flight Movement Power versus the lava's attempt to Counter.
If she decides to dive in it to see if there's something at the bottom
and her only defense is Acrobatics, then the lava doesn't need to
roll--she's going to get burned.

#### Creating an Obstacle or Peril

Characters can create Obstacles or Perils with their Abilities. Generally,
treat these as if they have the same Power Level as the Ability used
to create it. If a character uses his PL 6 Ice Ray to create an ice
slick on the floor, that becomes a PL 6 Obstacle to anybody trying
to cross it. The character won't have to continue to spend Actions
in subsequent Rounds; instead the Obstacle should last a reasonable
amount of time, generally until the end of the scene unless somebody
Disables it to eliminate it.

#### Out by a Peril {#sec:OutByAPeril}

One important difference between a Peril and a enemy is that when
it comes to being Out, in most campaigns enemies will let up rather
than attempt to finish the job if for no other reason than they have
bigger fish to fry than beating on a helpless character. Perils, particularly
when they're environmental factors like high radiation or poison gas,
will continue as long as the character remains exposed, putting the
character Down for the Count on the second Round. This can present
a problem if you want a low-lethality campaign; if so the GM should
give the character's companions ample opportunity to rescue the character
before any permanent harm is done, if necessary helping along by narrating
the Out in such a way that rescue is still plausible (e.g., falling
victim to the fumes on a small outcropping surrounded by the lava
rather than plunging right into it). If they fail to do so, and there's
no plausible way for the character to jump back in after the usual
three Turns then the character is missing, presumed dead. The player
should decide whether to leave the character in that state for a while,
playing a different character in the meantime, or have the character
return almost immediately. In any case, in order to return, the player
needs to come up with an explanation for the character's miraculous
escape.

Note that it is perfectly acceptable to use a Shtick to create a Peril
or Obstacle; this is one way you can promote a non-combat Ability
to be useful in combat. Thus, a character with a Computer Systems
Shtick couldn't use it to attack a group of Empire Troopers directly,
but could use the Shtick to override the blast doors separating them,
thus creating an Obstacle they would have to surmount, or even open
the hangar bay doors, creating a Peril that threatens to sweep them
out into the void of space. The disadvantage, of course, is that Obstacles
and Perils don't discriminate between the character's friends and
foes, so an ally on the wrong side of the blast doors is just as stuck
as the Troopers, and in just as much trouble when the chamber is voided
into space.

Equipment[\[chap:Equipment\]]{#chap:Equipment label="chap:Equipment"}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In most Science Fiction, equipment plays a big part in the story,
whether it's the smuggler's trusty blaster or the science officer's
tricorder. In Zap! you should assume that Powers and Shticks that
you use require equipment. and the equipment you're using should be
part of your narration of what you're doing. You are reduced to one
die (as if you were Hindered) in that Ability if you don't have appropriate
equipment (e.g. guns or knives for a Power like Soldier, medical kit
for a Shtick such as Doctor). Abilities that have taken the Advantage
Bare-handed aren't subject to this; a typical such Power might be
Martial Arts. Abilities that have the Disadvantage Equipment Required
don't even get a single die; they just can't be used.

Most of the time, players can assume they have whatever equipment
they need to hand\...or just pick up some improvised equipment. Somebody
with a Power Elite Commando caught without a rifle while in a hotel
dirt-side on R&R when some terrorists attack can narrate grabbing
a handy mop and breaking off the head to use as a staff until she
can knock one out and take his gun. The point is to encourage such
narration for flavor, not to enforce bookkeeping of everything the
character is carrying at every moment. There should, however, be times
when in all fairness it is unreasonable to assume that there is adequate
equipment handy, and the player should endure the handicap until some
can be procured.

### Equipment Dice

Specific pieces of Equipment in Zap! are rated in terms of a single
die; characters using the equipment can use that die in place of one
of their own if it would improve the dice rolled. For instance, a
pistol might be rated at d6. An untrained person who would ordinary
roll a d2 for his attack would instead roll a d6. A trained police
officer with a Power Police Training 4 would roll a d6, d4 instead
of d4, d4. If he had PL 5 he'd roll d6, d6 instead of d6, d4. On the
other hand, an Elite Commando PL 8 would still roll d8, d8; the pistol
wouldn't improve on that, though it would justify using both dice
instead of being reduced to one for being unequipped. Equipment can
be given the same Advantages and Disadvantages that Abilities can,
raising and lowering the Equipment Rating by one die size instead
of one Power Level. E.g. a Pistol d6 with the Shots Disadvantage becomes
d8; a Grenade d8 with the Area Effect Advantage becomes d6, etc.

#### Typical Equipment Dice

  Equipment         Die   Cost\*
  ---------------- ----- --------
  Small/Minor       d4      2
  Medium            d6      3
  Large/Major       d8      4
  Rare/Expensive    d10     5
  Legendary         d12     6

\* if used. See.

#### Variations in Equipment

You should assume that there is wide variation in capabilities of
the items listed, even if its not reflected in a mechanical difference
between the items. These differences should become fodder for the
Primary Rule in play. For example, mechanically all primitive armor
is just a d4 vs. muscle-powered weapons, but that doesn't mean that
in play you should treat plate armor and a leather jacket as being
identical; you are strongly encouraged to decide on the fly that,
say, according to the Primary Rule and the tone of the campaign swimming
underwater in plate is forbidden, but a dagger has no chance of even
Hindering somebody clad in plate except under special circumstances
such as in combination with an attack that immobilizes the wearer.

The GM and players are strongly encouraged to invent details about
the equipment in keeping with the setting, even if the details have
no game-mechanical effect, since they can provide fodder for the Primary
Rule. For instance in the modern day there are many makes and models
of cars, with varying features such as numbers of doors, convertible
roofs, automatic or manual transmission, differences in trunk size,
side of the car the gas-cap is on, and so on. Any of these things
might plausibly come up in the course of play as justifying or forbidding
certain actions based on the Primary Rule, even though in game terms
anything from a Toyota Camry to a VW Beetle or a Ford F150 pickup
truck might be described simply as Ground Car d6. In a SF setting,
equipment is likely to be just as varied and interesting, and the
GM players should try to bear that in mind, inventing details where
necessary.

### Maintenance[\[sec:Maintenance\]]{#sec:Maintenance label="sec:Maintenance"}

Equipment in most SF settings needs routine maintenance. Once per
session, the players should spend a Scene describing how they're performing
maintenance on some single piece of equipment, either all together
on something big such as a ship's component or each character on her
own equipment; this stands in for all the maintenance that they need
to do on all their equipment to keep it in good repair. If they skip
this scene, all their equipment acquires the Erratic Disadvantage
(fails to operate on a Mishap) until the scene is performed.

### Equipment Mishaps[\[sec:Equipment-Mishaps\]]{#sec:Equipment-Mishaps label="sec:Equipment-Mishaps"}

A roll of doubles when using Equipment is a chance of a Mishap, or
a 1 if you're only rolling 1 die. If there's a chance of a Mishap,
roll a d12 and get higher than the Equipment Die size to prevent the
Mishap. Remember you only have to check for Mishaps if you have a
Disadvantage that requires it, such as the Erratic Disadvantage from
not maintaining the equipment. (If you find it simpler you can just
roll a d12 when you have to check for Mishaps and a 1 is a Mishap;
it's just a matter of whether you prefer to have to roll an extra
d12 every time or only once in a while.)

![image](StrangeWorlds.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

### Reparing and Building Equipment

In order to repair broken equipment make an opposed roll of a suitable
ability vs. the equipment's die; beating the equipment's roll means
it can be repaired. The number it rolled is the number of Rounds it
will take to make operational in combat, or Scenes out-of-combat.
This biases repair times in favor of quick repairs in combat, but
that matches most of the genre fiction. Failure in combat means that
it needs to be repaired out of combat; failure out-of-combat means
it needs to be replaced, at least in part.

Building new equipment works essentially the same way, but must be
done out-of-combat unless using a Scientist's Science! skill. New
equipment costs roughly the same as buying the equipment, unless it
seems plausible that 90% of the cost of the equipment is labor (as
might be the case with primitive labor-intensive items such as mail
armor). See for more about Wealth and costs.
The advantage to building it yourself is that you can get equipment
to your exact specifications, or in places that it might not otherwise
be available on local markets.

### Cybernetic Enhancemetns

Generally speaking cybernetic enhancements, or cyberwear, shouldn't
be purchased as Equipment in Zap! Rather, since once installed it
becomes an innate part of the character it would be purchased with
personal Boosts. Only in a setting where cybernetic enhancements were
frequently swapped in and out during the course of an adventure according
to the needs of the moment would it make sense to write it up as equipment
and let players purchase it for their characters with wealth.

In such a setting, assume that nearly anything that could be purchased
as Equipment can be installed as an enhancement, but would Cost would
+1 for the Advantage Cyberwear, and possibly another +1 if it has
the Advantage Concealable as well.

### Example Equipment[\[sec:Example-Equipment\]]{#sec:Example-Equipment label="sec:Example-Equipment"}

Not all of this equipment will be available in every setting, and
the GM is encouraged to change the basic parameters to better match
the setting. Perhaps all Laser guns must have the Burnout Disadvantage
to represent the limited lifespan of the tubes that generate the laser.
Even if the equipment exists in the setting, there's no guarantee
that the PCs will be able to purchase it: a Portal Gun might be a
top secret weapon, only available as a prototype in a sinister laboratory.

Ships[\[chap:Ships\]]{#chap:Ships label="chap:Ships"}
-----------------------------------------------------

Ships in Zap! are treated as characters in their own right, but they
have slightly different Attributes: Toughness, Hull Capacity, Power,
and Crew.

Ships are also rated by Scale which describes how large and effective
they are compared to other ships; Scale is not an Attribute.

Toughness works exactly as it does for characters.

Hull Capacity is the number of slots the ship has to fit Powers; a
Power takes up 1 Hull Space, a Shtick takes 1/2 a Hull Space. You
can't have fractional Hull Capacity values, but you can have unused
space. Hull Capacity values are fixed when the ship is constructed;
you can upgrade everything else about a ship, but if you want a bigger
hull you need a new ship.

Power is how much power the ship has for running systems, primarily
for purposes of pushing more power into them using such Tropes as
"Divert Power to\..." Power functions
more or less as a combination of Will and Stamina.

Crew is how many Actions the ship can take in a Round, not counting
actions performed by the PCs. Crew 0 means that any Ability you want
to use in a Turn must have a PC assigned to it.

How fast ships travel between planets and stars is at a different
Scope from individual characters, and is determined by the Campaign
Scope for the setting. That is, if the campaign is Scope 10 Near Interstellar,
then all ships in the campaign are presumed to be Scope 10 unless
otherwise noted.

Typical Powers for Ships include: Weapons, Shields, FTL Drive, Impulse
Engines.

Typical Shticks include Sensors, Life Support, Sick Bay, Cargo Bay(s),
Labs, Engineering, Hydroponics, Vehicle Bay, Shuttle Bay, Life Pods,
Cold Sleep Chambers, Recreation Deck, Brig, Ship's Stores, Ship's
Library.

Any Power that would be typical in the setting but that your ship
is not equipped with is assumed to be present, but at minimal Power
Level (Default Skill), unless that would be silly (a Brig on a one-man
fighter).

![image](night_landing_by_jamused-d3nnm14.png){width="7.5in"}

### Ship Templates[\[sec:Ship-Templates\]]{#sec:Ship-Templates label="sec:Ship-Templates"}

These are minimal ships of their type; larger ships will have more
Hull space for more Powers like Sensors and FTL drive (if the setting
distinguishes between FTL and STL drives), Shticks such as Engineering
and Ships Library, and more.

Ships are treated like characters in their own right when it comes
to increasing their Boosts: the first additional Boost on a Ship cost
1 XP. Each Boost after that costs as many XP as the Ship has in Boosts
(2, then 3, then 4, and so on). If you are using the optional Wealth
rules, WP may be substituted for XP.

### Ship Advantages and Disadvantages[\[sec:Ship-Advantages-and\]]{#sec:Ship-Advantages-and label="sec:Ship-Advantages-and"}

You can place Advantages and Disadvantages from the list for characters
on Ship's systems, if it makes sense. In addition there are certain
Advantages and Disadvantages apply only to a ship's Abilities.

#### Ship Advantages

Small Advantages are labeled (A), Big Advantages (AA)

Power is reduced by 1 PL each time a successful
hit is scored, but Damage is stepped down one level (Overkill becomes
Out, Out becomes Hindered, Hindered becomes no effect).

Doesn't require Crew to operate.

If Out, a replacement system 2 PL
lower can be brought online for one Action next Round

Treat Out as Hindered; Overkill as Out

for this ship Combat Range has an extra
section: Long Range. At long Range you can fire this Power with 2
dice while the enemy can only reply with 1 (unless they also have
Long Range Powers). Movement between sections occurs as normal (that
is, it requires an Action to change range).

same as Long Range, but with
an additional Combat Range section where you can fire with 2 dice
and they need either Long or Extreme Range weapons to return fire
(Long returns fire with 1 die, Extreme with 2).

Requires no Hull space.

Requires half as much Hull space, i.e. two
Mini systems in one Hull space.

Outside of combat, the system restores
itself by one level per Scene (Overkill becomes Out, Out becomes Hindered,
etc.)

#### Ship Disadvantages[\[subsec:Ship-Disadvantages\]]{#subsec:Ship-Disadvantages label="subsec:Ship-Disadvantages"}

Small Disadvantages are labeled (D), Big Disadvantages (DD)

Long Range Only (D)

:   for this ship Combat Range has an extra
    section: Long Range. This weapon can only fire at Long Range.

Short-Range (D)

:   for this ship Combat Range has an extra section:
    Short Range; this weapon is reduced to one die if longer than Short
    Range, and can't fire at all at Pursuit Range.

Short-Range Forbidden (D)

:   for this ship Combat Range has an
    extra section: Short Range; this weapon cannot fire at Short Range.

### Ship Restrictions[\[sec:Ship-Restrictions\]]{#sec:Ship-Restrictions label="sec:Ship-Restrictions"}

Ships can have Restrictions, similar to those that characters have,
that greatly limit their capabilities. This list isn't exhaustive,
but suggests how severe a penalty a Restriction ought to be. A Restriction
on a Ship grants the ship one more Boost to spend. Ship Restrictions
cannot be bought off with Boosts at a later date.

Cannot Land

:   Too large or fragile to land on a planet, it will
    require shuttle craft or the equivalent to transport crew and cargo.

Cranky

:   Systems are chronically erratic; every session roll a
    random system, which is treated as having the Erratic Disadvantage
    for the duration of the session

Exotic

:   All repairs or upgrades require an extra 1 WP be spent
    because parts are hard to come by due to the ship being obsolete,
    alien, of foreign manufacture, etc. In addition, Exotic ships are
    more likely to be recognized and remembered.

Hangar Queen

:   Systems are constantly breaking; every session
    roll a d12, on a 1 a random system is Hindered. If a Mishap comes
    up on the Repair roll, the system is Broken and needs replacement
    parts.

No Hardpoints

:   Incapable of mounting weapons that occupy Hull
    space.

### Ship Complications[\[sec:Ship-Complications\]]{#sec:Ship-Complications label="sec:Ship-Complications"}

Just as with characters, every ship should have Complications; ships
can have one Major or two Minor Complications. Again as with characters,
you may freely change your ships Complications between adventures
to keep things fresh. Some possible Complications are:

Absentee Owner

:   the ship is actually owned by somebody else,
    and you are using it only so long as you are carrying out their wishes.
    This could be an informal arrangement where you are merely on call
    if they need it, or the ship could be on active service in some organization
    and you are merely employees carrying out orders

Famous

:   the ship is widely known and recognized; this can make
    it hard to be inconspicuous. This might be a case of mistaken identity

Haunted

:   it may be a glitch in the systems, or an actual haunt,
    but strange things sometimes happen aboard: lights on where they shouldn't
    be, hatches undogged when they should be, cold spots that the ship's
    internal sensors don't register\...

Mortgage

:   you don't own the ship outright, and have to keep coming
    up with money to make payments on it. This should be played as a motivation
    to keep earning money, or occasional plot point, not as a particular
    amount of WP you need to fork over every session.

Temperamental

:   nothing is actually wrong with the ships systems,
    but every once in a while one will require more than one try to activate
    at inconvenient moment.

Unlucky Reputation

:   somehow things always seem to go wrong for
    the owners of the ship, or so the story goes. Sometimes it can be
    hard to find crew, or shippers might hesitate to employ it.

Wanted

:   somebody believes they have a claim to ownership, and
    they want it back. Their claim might even be valid\...

### Ship-to-Ship Combat[\[sec:Ship-to-Ship-Combat\]]{#sec:Ship-to-Ship-Combat label="sec:Ship-to-Ship-Combat"}

Ship-to-ship takes place the same way that combat between characters
does, except that Damage is assigned randomly against the ship's Abilities
instead of taken against the ship as a whole. Each ship's system (Power
or Shtick) should be assigned a number. Each time an attacker scores
a success, figure out the degree of success as normal and then roll
a die to see which system was hit. Systems that are Hindered are still
operational, but at one die; systems that are Out are broken, but
repairable, and systems that are Overkilled are destroyed.

  Damage Steps
  -------------------------
  Operational (Undamaged)
  Hindered
  Broken (Out)
  Destroyed (Overkill)

When rolling for damage location in ship-to-ship combat Automatic
defensive abilities have no special resistance to being Hindered or
Out: if the die-roll for damage location indicates they are hit, they
take the damage.

When systems are destroyed, do not reduce the size of the die you're
using to determine the system hit; if an already destroyed system
is hit again, reduce the Crew by 1, if the Crew is reduced to zero,
then the ship is Out unless there are PCs left on it. If there are
PCs on the ship, and the Crew is at 0, then each time the Crew is
would be reduced by 1, a PC is Out; the PC should be chosen randomly
from the ones working on the system, or if none were then from the
remaining PCs.

If an already destroyed system is hit by an an Overkill, the ship
is destroyed regardless of remaining Crew. A ship is also destroyed
if all of its systems are destroyed. Anything less, and the crew of
the ship or PCs can still attempt to get its systems---or at least
some of them---working again.

This means that while ships with larger hulls, more systems, and more
Crew are in general harder to render helpless, a lucky shot can destroy
one, and battles don't drag out until the final system of the ship
is broken.

#### Attempts to Disable[\[subsec:Attempts-to-Disable\]]{#subsec:Attempts-to-Disable label="subsec:Attempts-to-Disable"}

You can attempt to Disable a specific system, as per the usual rules,
but you must roll twice: first against the ship's normal defenses,
and only if you beat them proceed to roll against the Power Level
of the system you are targeting. You may not attempt to Disable any
system that isn't represented by an Ability. E.g. if the target ship
doesn't have Sensors as one of its Powers or Shticks, it's assumed
that they are too spread out, small, or redundant to make a legitimate
identifiable target. Automatic Defenses *do* have the usual resistance
to being reduced if they are specifically targeted: the damage level
can never be more than Hindered unless the attacker is using a Power
with the Disabling Only Advantage.

#### Repairs[\[subsec:Repairs\]]{#subsec:Repairs label="subsec:Repairs"}

Repairing systems decreases their damage by one step. You need to
Repair a system more than once to bring it back up multiple steps.

Hindered systems can be Repaired by characters with the appropriate
Abilities by spending an entire Round and making an opposed roll against
the PL of the system (more powerful systems are trickier to repair).
If they beat the system's roll, the system is back up immediately;
if they fail, the shortfall is the number of Rounds before the system
will be back online. E.g. Spotty tries to repair the ship's Engines
with his Engineering 5 vs. the ship's engines of 6. He rolls d6, d4
and gets a 2, the engines roll d6, d6 and get a 5: it will be 3 Rounds
before they're back online. Rolling a Mishap causes system to "attack"
technician doing the repairs.

If the characters don't like the result they can spend another Round
to re-roll, but if the result is worse they've experienced a set-back
and it will indeed take longer than they originally thought. They
can keep trying rolls as many Rounds as they wish, but Rounds spent
this way don't count towards the Rounds until the System is repaired.
During this time the Hindered system continues to remain available
at a single die. If they wished to take the system offline completely,
that will reduce the amount of time it will take to repair it by **3**
Rounds (to a minimum 1 Round).

Broken systems can be Repaired, using the same procedure as Hindered
systems, but require parts. Ships with an actual Ships Stores Ability
or the equivalent may roll vs. the PL of the system that needs parts:
success means the needed parts are available; failure means resorting
to one of the other options. Parts not available from the stores can
be obtained by cannibalizing other ship's systems, or by adventuring
for them.

Destroyed systems cannot be repaired in combat. Out of combat, they
can be Repaired with a successful roll at the cost of 1 XP; a failure
means they are thoroughly destroyed and must be repurchased.

If you are using the optional Wealth rules, you can obtain replacement
parts by spending 1 Wealth Point. This happens immediately, even during
combat, to reduce book-keeping; it's assumed the parts are scrounged
from non-critical parts that will need replacing. If you don't have
the WP, you may make the repair, but you cannot make any future repairs
except by cannibalizing until you've spent a WP on restocking parts;
presumably if you're running a ship while that poor, you've been putting
off resupplying and scrounging everything that was scroungeable for
already just for routine maintenance. Destroyed systems may be repaired
on a successful roll by spending 1 WP instead of 1 XP.

#### Cannibalizing[\[subsec:Cannibalizing\]]{#subsec:Cannibalizing label="subsec:Cannibalizing"}

Any ship's system that's an actual Ability can be cannibalized: cannibalizing
systems increases the damage they've taken by one step. Destroyed
systems can be cannibalized, but it requires a roll equivalent to
the Repair roll (roll vs. PL to see how many Rounds before you can
recover useful parts). If a character rolls a Mishap while cannibalizing
a Destroyed system, she suffers an attack as it explodes or short-circuits:
roll the systems PL vs. the appropriate defense. You can cannibalize
from the same system more than once, increasing its damage by one
step each time, but once you've cannibalized a Destroyed system it
cannot be Repaired even out of combat, and must be purchased anew.

#### Life Support Failing\...[\[subsec:Life-Support-Failing\]]{#subsec:Life-Support-Failing label="subsec:Life-Support-Failing"}

If a ship ever loses Life Support, either because of damage to the
system or because it was powered down (as in Silent Running), the
crew will start to suffer.

Each Round in combat or Scene outside of combat, make a Hindered (one
die) Life Support roll vs. the Crew Attribute, or the Crew become
Tired: all ship's systems they control operate at one die. If they
become Tired twice, they become Out. Another **3** times after
that they are Out and they start dying. Use the Hindered Life Support
roll even if the system is destroyed: better, more powerful Life Support
systems take longer to degrade.

Each time a Tired result comes up, PCs can elect to sacrifice one
point of Stamina instead. At 0 Stamina they are Out. If the ship has
no Crew Attribute (the PCs are the only crew), treat it as a Tired
result any time a 1 comes up on the Life Support roll.

#### PC Actions[\[subsec:PC-Actions\]]{#subsec:PC-Actions label="subsec:PC-Actions"}

When PCs are aboard a ship they may either spend their Actions using
their own Abilities, such as when they are running around trying to
repair things on the ship, provide medical assistance to the crew,
or do research in the lab to cobble together a weapon to stop the
alien attackers, *or* they may serve as crew manning one of the
ship's abilities. Each PC that takes over supervising the functions
of one of the ship's Abilities in effect gives the ship an extra Action
during that Round, at the expense of that PC's own Actions. When PCs
are using the ship's Abilities, they treat it as Equipment, using
the better of the Ability's best die and their own best die or the
Ability's dice. E.g. if the ship's guns are PL 6 (d6, d6), a PC who
had Gunner 8 (d8, d8) would roll a d8, d6 (her great gunning improves
the chances, but she's still limited by how good the guns are); a
PC who had Gunner 4 (d4, d4) would roll a d6, d6 (having a PC in charge
never makes the it worse).

#### Ship Tropes[\[subsec:Ship-Tropes\]]{#subsec:Ship-Tropes label="subsec:Ship-Tropes"}

##### Divert Power to the\...

Equivalent to the Supreme Effort Trope for characters, you can add
the ship's Power rating to a roll, after which the Power drops by
one. If the Power reaches zero, the ship's systems operate at one
die, much as when a character is Tired.

##### The Engines Can't Take It!

A character with an Engineering Ability or the equivalent can use
the equivalent of the Supreme Effort Trope to add her Will to a roll
involving the engines or power plant, after which the system becomes
Broken.

##### Silent Running

By powering down all systems, including life support, the ship becomes
invisible or thought of as derelict to any scans at longer than Short
Range (any other ship that wasn't already at Short Range per the Short
Range Disadvantages would have to spend Actions to close to Short
Range before they could detect the ruse). Each Round you spend in
Silent Running requires a Life Support roll.

#### Option: Faster Ship Combat

Standard ship-to-ship combat in Zap! takes approximately as long as
a normal combat between the characters as individuals and a similar
number of foes, with systems being eliminated one-by-one and the characters
having time to repair them\...although a lucky shot or clever tactics
can end it faster; this is by design, since the elimination of the
character's ship generally defeats the entire party at once.

If you prefer to speed up ship-to-ship combat, one way is to have
each hit on a specific system knock it down one level. Thus, a Hindered
system that takes another hit would become Broken, even if the damage
didn't exceed the ship's Toughness.

You can speed it up even more by treating the ship as a single character,
and having entire ship become Hindered or Broken as a single unit.
This offers a lot less leeway for individual characters to make a
difference, or for manuevering and reversals of fortune, but is much
more practical when more than a couple of ships are involved.

You can decide which way you will handle combat on a case-by-case
basis, or even distinguish between ships so that capital class ships
take damage to individual systems while lesser ships are treated as
a unit. You could even have only the PC's ship use the detailed approach,
while all enemy ships are treated as single units.

### Ship Scale[\[sec:Ship-Scopes\]]{#sec:Ship-Scopes label="sec:Ship-Scopes"}

The Scale for a ship describes how large and effective that ship is
compared to other ships regardless of Adventure Scope. A ship could
range from a single-person craft to a colony ship with millions of
inhabitants regardless of whether the Adventure Scope is 10 (Near
Interstellar) or 14 (Galactic Cluster). The Scale of the Ship is the
number of digits in the crew complement. A ship at Scale 1 has crew
in the single digits; a ship at Scale 3 has hundreds of crew, and
so on. If you're using the optional Wealth rules, that's also the
Scale of ship's . The Crew attribute indicates
how many crew the ship has given the Scale.

E.g. a smuggler's ship with a handful of crew would have Ship Scale
1. If the ship's Crew Attribute were 2, that would indicate 2 crew
members; a deep-space exploration vessel with 435 crew would be Crew
4 at Scale 3. A battle carrier with 1,000 crew members could be Crew
10 at Scale 3 or Crew 1 at Scale 4, depending on what's more convenient
for the setting: is it one of the largest ships in its class, or the
smallest? A ship the size of a moon with around 300,000 crew would
be Crew 3 at Scale 6, and so on.

   Ship Scale    \~Crew per point
  ------------ ------------------
       1                        1
       2                       10
       3                      100
       4                    1,000
       5                   10,000
       6                  100,000
       7                1,000,000
       8               10,000,000
       9              100,000,000
       10           1,000,000,000
       11          10,000,000,000
       12         100,000,000,000

#### Ship Scale and Effectiveness

When ships of different Scales are in combat, their non-Movement Abilities
are scaled; Movement Abilities and Attributes remain fixed since it's
typical in Science Fiction for small ships to be able to outrun larger
ones, and to be able to survive one or more hits even from a bigger
ship's weapons. For every Scale you move a ship, raise or lower the
score on its Abilities by 2 depending on whether the ship is being
shifted to a Scale where it's relatively more or less powerful. Abilities
never go below 1. Usually you would shift the side that has the fewest
different types of ships, to minimize the work; otherwise, leave the
PC's ship(s) and shift their enemies, so the players can just look
at what's listed on the character sheet.

E.g. the Peregrine runs across an Empire Star-cruiser, a Scale 3 ship
with hundreds of crew and huge guns. At its normal Scale the Star-cruiser
has Guns 5, Shields 4, and Drive 3. At Scale 1 its Guns count as 9,
the Shields count as 8, and the Drive remains at 3. None of the Attributes
change.

If you were doing it the other way around, shifting the Peregrine
to Scale 3, the Peregrine's Movement 5, Deflector Shields 4 and Gun
Turrets 4 become Movement 5, Deflector Shields 1, and Gun Turrets
1.

##### Settings with Multiple Adventure Scopes

If the campaign setting actually has multiple Adventure Scopes, say
with some cultures at Scope 10 (Near Interstellar) and others at Scope
14 (Galactic Cluster), Ship Scale is subordinate to the Adventure
Scope; that is, a Ship Scale 3 ship belonging to a Galactic Cluster
civilization is presumably much more powerful than a Ship Scale 6
craft belonging to the Near Interstellar culture. In situations with
mixed Scopes like this, if it becomes necessary to compare the ships
in combat or with one trying to evade the other, first convert the
ships from Adventure Scope to Adventure Scope using the
rules, then if necessary from Ship Scale to Ship Scale.

E.g. if the Star-cruiser from the previous example came from a Scope
14 civilization and the Peregrine from a Scope 12, the Star-cruiser
would first be converted from Guns 5, Shields 4, and Drive 3 to Guns
8, Shields 6, Drive 5, and then to Guns 12, Shields 10, Drive 5. On
the other hand, if the Star-cruiser were from a Scope 10 civilization,
the Star-cruiser would first be reduced to Guns 3, Shields 2, Drive
1 by translating two Scopes upward, and the shifted to Guns 7, Shields
6, Drive 1 to put it on the same Ship Scale as the Peregrine.

Trekking
--------

Science Fiction stories often have a good deal of fairly routine travel:
not every space voyage is punctuated by pirate attack, receiving a
distress call, or encountering a mysterious alien entity. But if play
skips over the days, weeks, or even months of routine to get to the
"good stuff" space can end up feeling very small, with treks halfway
across the galaxy feeling like a trip down to the corner store. To
combat this and give texture to the routine ship-board activities
that make up a large part of genre, Zap! uses a "just the highlights"
system called Trekking, which rates travel distances in terms of Scenes
needed to complete the travel.

Based on the Adventure Scope and technology of the setting, the GM
should determine how much subjective time (how many Scenes) should
pass to trek between the closest points for long-distance highlights-only
travel. Longer distances should then be made proportional to that.
For example, at a Near Interstellar Scope, the GM could decide that
distances between planets in a single solar system using "impulse
power" should take a few days, while the closest stars would be
weeks away using "warp drive", and the frontier a couple of months.
Based on this, she decides that travel between planets takes between
one and three Scenes; between close stars 6 to 12, and the frontier
would be 21+ Scenes away. Note the deliberate discontinuity, so that
embarking on an interstellar journey feels like a significantly more
time-consuming enterprise than hopping around in-system; also note
that the number of scenes needn't be strictly proportional\...if a
trip that takes a day requires one Scene, a trip that takes a week
doesn't necessarily require seven Scenes. A GM who wanted the players
to be able to flit from system to system more casually could reduce
the numbers, say to 1, 3 and 6 Scenes respectively, or even skip Trekking
entirely and hand-wave everything as "3 months later, you arrive."

![image](heic0305a-copy.png_effected.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

### Scenes[\[sec:Scenes\]]{#sec:Scenes label="sec:Scenes"}

A Scene during Trekking is exactly like a scene in a book or a movie:
a single situation or incident, usually in a single location. This
can be a description by one of the players some activity their character
is performing during the trip, such as maintaining their equipment
(see ), training, performing Research, or
role-playing a conversation or interaction between several of the
PCs or the PCs and NPCs. It can also be some incident or encounter
that the GM presents: if the ship actually does encounter some pirates
or a distress call, that counts as a Scene towards completion of the
journey. Scenes needn't all take place shipboard; feel free to include
stops along the way to refuel, trade, explore, or for some R&R, as
appropriate for the setting and the PC's goals. Some of these may
turn into adventures in their own right, while others might just be
short interludes and an opportunity to insert some local color.

Scenes can be as short or as long as you care to make them, but the
point of playing out the Scenes is to give the players some interesting
memories of what happened during their trek from Point A to Point
B, not merely to force them to do a slow count to ten before the action
can resume. This is a good opportunity to work in some of the Complications
of the various characters or the ship itself, or to give some spotlight
time to characters that haven't been front-and-center of the action
recently.

### Translating Distance to Scenes[\[sec:Translating-Distance-to\]]{#sec:Translating-Distance-to label="sec:Translating-Distance-to"}

If the GM has worked out exact travel distances between various locales
and speeds for various forms of transportation, that can be translated
directly into Scenes by assigning a unit of time for a One-Scene trip.
E.g. if you say travel takes one Scene per day, then a ship capable
of traveling 1 light-year per day would take 12 Scenes to complete
a 12 light-year trip, while a ship that can travel 6 light-years per
day would take only 2 Scenes for the same trip. Fractional Scenes
should be dropped. If the setting uses more abstract distance, like
"Jumps" of a fixed duration, you can peg the Scenes to Jumps,
say 2 Scenes per jump.

Even though the way you work out the number of Scenes supposes a certain
number of scenes per unit of time, that doesn't imply that Scenes
ought to take that long, or be spaced out evenly. E.g. if you're translating
one week's travel = one Scene, the individual Scenes don't have to
occur one per week like clockwork; if it makes sense, you should immediately
follow one Scene with another, such as a Scene where the PCs decide
to land on a planet to trade followed immediately by another Scene
where they hunt for bargains in the bazaar, and another where they
get drunk in a local bar. If that's all the Scenes that are required
to complete the journey they were on, that just means that you should
make the remaining weeks pass without incident once they get underway
again.

The GM could also use a sliding scale, typically to make longer distance
travel less tedious, such as by making Trekking take one Scene per
day up to 7 Scenes, then an additional two Scene per week up to one
month (another 8 Scenes), and three Scenes per month's travel thereafter.
This would have the advantage of making a contemplated 6 month journey
still seem like it would take a significant amount of time as measured
in Scenes without forcing the players to figure out 180 Scenes to
fill up the time; on the other hand, depending on the setting you
might want a six month journey that crosses the entirety of known
space to be a daunting prospect that will take months of playing\...or
at least prod the players into thinking about getting a faster ship.

### Cutting to the Chase[\[sec:Cutting-to-the\]]{#sec:Cutting-to-the label="sec:Cutting-to-the"}

Don't slow down the action or insist on playing out the Scenes just
to prolong the process of travel. If the players are chasing some
fleeing bad-guys, by all means skip ahead, even if it would normally
amount to a bunch more Scenes. Keep a sense of pacing, and don't fritter
away any sense of urgency the players have built up. If they want
to cut to the chase, oblige them. If they don't want to play out the
process of traveling at all, and would rather just start each adventure
orbiting a new planet, then drop the Trekking rules all together\...though
you should probably still try to include some time in each session
for "down time" activities. Even action-adventure SF TV shows
usually include some scenes of normal activity each episode as a change
of pace or to allow for character development; non-stop action can
be as tedious as no action at all.

### Typical Scenes[\[sec:Typical-Scenes\]]{#sec:Typical-Scenes label="sec:Typical-Scenes"}

The GM and players can pick from any of these, or make up their own.
If the players want an encounter, they should feel free to "pick
it up on scanners" or "receive a distress signal" even if the
GM isn't inflicting it on them.

Research
--------

Science and engineering form core elements of Science Fiction stories,
so it's not surprising that many protagonists are scientists or engineers
and are constantly doing research or tinkering with devices. In Zap! characters
with the Scientist Template can do Research Scenes to revise and expand
their Science! Power to the needs of the adventure, but that's just
one way that research into new technology, devices, and scientific
knowledge can come into play. Characters may also perform Research
to gain new Assets and improve upon their existing ones.

Once each session, characters may perform a Research scene using any
appropriate Ability (the Scientist's Scientific Research Shtick, or
any science or engineering Shtick that characters using other Templates
may have). The characters choose an Asset (see[\[sec:Assets\]](#sec:Assets){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:Assets"}) that
they want to improve upon with research and tinkering, or a new Asset
they want to create. The Difficulty for the Research is the PL of
the Asset. Scoring a success grants 1 XP for improving that Asset,
or towards its purchase for a new one; if the 1 XP from success isn't
enough to buy the improvement or new Asset immediately, "bank"
it as belonging to that particular Asset. When making a Research roll,
always check for a Mishap even if the Power doesn't have a Disadvantage
that would call for a check. If a Mishap occurs, the GM should invent
something interesting that went wrong, such as:

1.  Shower of sparks, some piece of equipment is broken.

2.  Small explosion; treat as a single attack on the researcher(s) at
    the PL of the Asset.

3.  Line of Research is set back, if any XP was accumulated on this Research
    lose 1 XP.

4.  Experiment sets off an adventure. Perhaps the researcher is split
    into a good version and a bad version, or it attracts a mischievous
    or hostile entity through a spacio-temporal rift, or the ship is hurtled
    back in time or to a different quadrant of the galaxy.

5.  Sudden insight. You can abandon this Research and put any XP already
    banked into a new line of Research, aiming at a new Asset.

6.  Serendipity! You've accidentally discovered something else entirely.
    GM grants you a Major Asset of her design.

"Interesting" in this context means that it has some effect on
the game besides just the description of colored lights and things
blowing up, although that effect need not have mechanics attached.

A new Minor Asset costs 1 XP; Major Assets that belong to the players
jointly cost 3 XP; Major Assets that belong to a particular character
cost as many XP as that character has Boosts. Improving Assets costs
as many XP as the Asset has in Boosts. A Minor Asset is generally
something like a piece of equipment: the PL is the die-size. A Major
Asset is generally something that's treated almost as a character,
like a Vehicle, Base, or Companion, with its own Attributes and Abilities.
The GM should determine what the Attributes and Abilities of a new
Major Asset are, following the description by the players of what
they're trying to Research.

When playing out a Research Scene, players are strongly encouraged
to describe what they're doing in some detail, even if it's just techno-babble,
and try their to fit the science and technology into the setting and
tone, whether that's "I'm adjusting the baryon filters on the warp
core to reverse the polarity of the tachyon flow, which if it works
should let us create a short-term temporal rift so we can travel back
in time" or "I'm duct-taping a grenade launcher and a flame-thrower
to my pulse rifle." Players can combine their Abilities, and should
add to the description: "I'll be monitoring the efficiency of the
baryon filters using my Radar Vision prosthesis, to warn if the filters
are becoming unstable."

If the campaign is using Wealth, you can substitute WP for any expenditure
of research XP; you can even use Research to generate WP by inventing
new processes or gizmos that you can sell or patent. The difficulty
of getting a Wealth Point via Research is your current Wealth PL,
with the usual results for Research Mishaps.

Experience {#sec:Experience}
----------

As you play the game you earn Experience (XP). Generally adventurers
earn one XP per session, plus one if they were put Out at least once
during the session, plus one more if the entire group was defeated.
(Defeat is an excellent teacher!) The GM may choose to award more,
up to two or three, for significant accomplishments, such as finally
completing a story arc that has been taking place over a number of
sessions.

Characters may earn an extra XP for "Going Boldly", volunteering
to place their character at the mercy of the GM in order to move the
plot along or get re-integrated in the main action if they've somehow
become separated.

Each character starts with 3 Boosts, plus some Templates have Bonus
Boosts. Every additional Boost after the start costs as much XP as
the *number of Boosts* your character has so far. Remember Assets
like Companions, Bases, and Vehicles do *not* count towards the
character's number of Boosts, nor do Bonus Boosts for the Templates
that have them. E.g., a starting Bad-Ass character has 3 Boosts plus
1 Bonus Boost, so it takes 3 XP to get an additional Boost. Once the
character spends the XP on a personal improvement the character has
4 Boosts and so the next Boost would cost 4 XP.

With one Boost you can:

Major Assets are treated as if they were characters: you keep track
of their Boosts, and increasing their Boosts costs as many XP as that
Asset currently has in Boosts, or 1 if it starts with 0. E.g., a Companion
starts with 0 Boosts so it costs 1 XP to give that Companion a Boost.
After that it's a 1 Boost Companion, and will cost 1 XP to improve
again to 2 Boost Companion, then 2 XP to get a 3rd Boost and so on.

You can also spend XP directly on Minor Assets, such as Favors, Perks,
Reputation, or Contacts. One new Minor Asset costs 1 XP, as does adding
1 level to an existing Minor Asset.

### The Pace Of Advancement {#sec:ThePaceOfAdvancement}

It may seem that characters will advance very slowly given this system;
it can be several sessions before a starting character can increase
the level of her main Power or get a new Power. This is generally
in keeping with the nature of the genre. SF stories don't usually
focus on the characters acquiring more and more personal power, "leveling
up" and getting new gear; when adventurers do get new powers it's
a big event, and usually comes as a result of something significant
happening during the course of an adventure or the start of a new
adventure, such as being captured and experimented on by a mad scientist
or alien race. Instead of altering the core of the character, as a
result of their adventures they widen their circle of contacts, aid
people who may then owe them favors, develop a reputation, make improvements
to their base of operations and all the other things that Zap! designates
as "Assets."

![image](05-scifi-happy-hero-guy-pointing-dials-tanks-knobs-men.png){width="0.74\\columnwidth"}

Wealth[\[chap:Wealth\]]{#chap:Wealth label="chap:Wealth"}
---------------------------------------------------------

Wealth is an optional system in Zap! Many Science Fiction settings
make the character's wealth irrelevant, or just part of the background:
the characters are doing what they do to make money, but how much
money is never really described nor do their actions seem particularly
constrained by what things cost. Even if the setting doesn't suppose
a post-scarcity economy, if you're on active duty and bankrolled by
Star Fleet, how much it took to build your ship or to keep it running
and in repair need never come up. On the other hand, a space-navy
campaign might well have the captain of a ship assigned a budget that
she needs to keep within, or have her personal wealth matter in terms
her share of prizes awarded for the capture of enemy vessels.

#### Wealth Levels[\[subsec:Wealth-Levels\]]{#subsec:Wealth-Levels label="subsec:Wealth-Levels"}

   Level             Amount
  ------- -----------------
     1                    1
     2                   10
     3                  100
     4                1,000
     5               10,000
     6              100,000
     7            1,000,000
     8           10,000,000
     9          100,000,000
    10        1,000,000,000
    11       10,000,000,000
    12      100,000,000,000

Each level of Wealth represents an order of magnitude of Wealth that's
available to your character; it doesn't represent a specific amount
of money, rather it's assumed that anything that cost less than that
order of magnitude (1,000's when your Wealth is measured in 10,000's)
is basically free as long as you don't try to stock up on a dozen
at a time. Things that are on the same order of magnitude (1,000's
when your Wealth is in the 1,000's) are significant investments for
you, and if you lose or expend them during play there's a chance that
your Wealth level is reduced. Wealth is not given a concrete name:
that is up to your setting. E.g. If the GM decides that a Laser Pistol
costs somewhere in the hundreds in the setting, then a character with
Wealth 3 can have one, but if she loses it that might adversely affect
her wealth; if she has Wealth 4, then replacing it or buying an extra
for a friend is no problem; a character with Wealth 1 won't be able
to afford one, and will have to try to get one in the course of adventuring.

### What Money is Called

Characters in the setting may be dealing in credits, quatloos, double-dollars,
cubits, and it may vary from place to place in the setting; all that
Zap! tracks is the number of *digits* of wealth you have.

### Wealth and Adventure

The GM should adjust your current Wealth level according to your fortunes
while adventuring, using the orders of magnitude as a guide. Generally
it's assumed that the character is making ends meet and the character's
income and expenses are in balance at the current Wealth level, including
normal rewards for adventures (bounties collected, pay for services,
and so on). If the character wants to increase Wealth through adventuring,
the player should tell the GM she's looking for riskier, higher paying
missions. If an employer offers the character substantially more than
the usual, such as 30,000 for a mission when the character's Wealth
Level is 2, after the mission the Wealth Level becomes 5\....assuming
the character survives and the employer pays up. Once at Wealth Level
5, missions and expenses will be assumed to be roughly on that scale.
On the other hand, if your Wealth Level is 7 and you have to abandon
ship and find yourself stranded on a semi-settled planet in nothing
more than your enviro-suit, your Wealth Level may be reduced to 2
or even 1.

![image](165726main_image_feature_721_ys_full.jpg){width="7.5in"}

### Wealth and Experience

Another way to increase your Wealth is simply to pay XP for it. Wealth
is treated as a Minor Asset: pay 1 XP to begin at Level 4, 2 more
XP to get to Level 5, etc. A starting character can thus start at
Wealth 5 by spending 1 Boost. If you lose your Wealth as a result
of an adventure, you don't get XP back. If your Wealth is increased
as a result of adventuring, you don't have to pay for that, but if
you want to increase it further, you have to pay the XP to the next
Level cost just as if you'd bought it up that far to begin with.

   Level   XP to next Level   Total
  ------- ------------------ -------
     4            2             1
     5            3             3
     6            4             6
     7            5            10
     8            6            15
     9            7            21
    10            8            28
    11            9            35
    12            10           44

E.g. to go from 7 to 8 Wealth costs 5 XP, regardless of whether you
got to 7 Wealth by adventuring, earning it through commerce, or spending
XP.

### Post-Scarcity Economies

Some SF posits a setting with a "post-scarcity economy", that
is one in which energy and matter are so abundant and so efficiently
processed that all material wealth is free for all practical purposes.
Except in the more outre or possibly within virtual environments,
this is almost never literally true\...there will be some things such
as star ships, space colonies, habitable planets, that the citizens
can't have as many as they want just for the taking. Nevertheless,
in terms of day-to-day needs, the citizens may live in such abundance
that there's no need to track their resources or expenses even on
the abstract level of orders of magnitude.

Mechanically, nothing could be easier than playing in a post-scarcity
economy: don't track wealth, let the characters have or create whatever
gear they want by means of replicators or whatever the setting uses,
though there should still be some limit according to the tech of the
setting as to what even the finest equipment is capable of.

The tricky bit is making sure that character's motivations and actions
still make sense, and adventures can still happen. If you're not paying
close attention, it can be easy to let some of the assumptions and
concerns of normal economies sneak in through the back door. You can't
just assume that there are mines, factories, hospitals, warehouses,
unless they're fully automated. If people don't engage in commerce,
what do they do all day? Is there such a thing as robbery? Gambling?
What would the stakes be? If there are still jobs that require humans,
what induces them to take the jobs?

Commerce
--------

Commerce is a large part of certain Science Fiction stories, and nearly
ignored in others, so like Wealth it's an optional system. Commerce
can be used independently of the Wealth system; just treat WP as being
XP in a setting that has Commerce without Wealth.

Using Commerce system, Wealth has its own experience points called
Wealth Points (WP). In order to increase your Wealth, you accumulate
WP through adventure or Commerce. It takes 10 WP to increase your
Wealth by one Level, regardless of your current level.

### Wealth and Scope

Individuals should generally use the
chart, regardless of their Personal Scope. Ships use Wealth at the
of the ship, where each level increase
in Scope increases the amount of wealth by a factor of 10. Thus, Wealth
4 for a Scope 3 ship is on the order of 100,000 instead of 1,000.
This affects the cost of repairs, as well as the profits to be made
if you're using the Commerce system (e.g., cargo for a Scope 3 ship
earns wealth on a scale 100 times larger than cargo for a Scope 1
ship).

If the players want to convert Wealth Points back and forth from the
ship's Scope to their own, convert it using the implied amount just
as if they had earned (or spent) wealth on an adventure. That is,
if the Ship Scope is 3 and it has Wealth 4, each WP it's earning is
approximately 100,000. If the players at Personal Scope 1 decide to
use one of those WP themselves that would immediately bump their own
Wealth to 6 (the level where their wealth is measured in the 100,000's);
if their Wealth was already 6, it would just go into their personal
pool of WP; if their Wealth was higher than 6, it wouldn't have any
effect. If the players in the example wanted to spend their own Wealth
Points to repair or improve the ship, they would likewise need either
to be Wealth 6 so that their WP were on the order of 100,000, or higher
than 6 in which case giving the ship one of their WP would raise its
Wealth score.

Note, however, that unless they own the ship free and clear, there
should probably be repercussions from them taking the Wealth the ship
has for their own use; if they are employees of the ship's owners,
it's embezzlement; if they are paying off a mortgage on the ship,
it's likely to make them late on payments; in any case it may make
the ship low on spare parts or having gone without proper maintenance.
The abstract measure of Wealth in Zap! assumes that at any given level
expenses and income are roughly in balance and are tied up in maintaining
that balance: Wealth Points are earnings towards increasing that Wealth,
but generally shouldn't be thought of as idle piles of money. If the
players start using them for other things, it should be used as fodder
for in-game happenings and complications.

### Shipping

One standard way for characters in SF settings to earn wealth is by
hiring out delivering goods and passengers. Usually this involves
having a ship, but sometimes the characters are themselves passengers
and are carrying or babysitting a smaller item or escorting a person.
Even in a campaign without Commerce, many adventures will fit this
rough structure; the Shipping rules don't replace actually playing
out such adventures, rather they give the characters who wish to engage
in commerce a simple, low risk, way to engage in some shipping "in
the background" and receive some WP rewards.

Players just announce they want to take on some cargo, and make a
roll of the relevant Movement Ability compared to difficulty equal
to the Movement PL **+ 3**. The result is how many travel Scenes
later they'll arrive at their destination and drop off the cargo for
1 WP. Shipping doesn't require setting a destination and actually
getting there; the presumption is that characters are only taking
on side-jobs carrying stuff to places they intend to go anyway. Naturally,
you should pay attention to the Primary Rule to avoid making this
ridiculous: if the characters need to do two travel Scenes to make
the delivery and two travel Scenes later they're back in the same
bar wait until they actually travel somewhere else before awarding
the WP.

The WP for shipping is on the same Scope as the Movement Ability that
was used; transporting stuff with a ship will usually yield WP on
a higher scale than the character walking under her own power.

### Trade

Trade consists of characters purchasing goods with their own wealth,
for resale later, hopefully at a profit. Trade is riskier than simply
agreeing to transport cargo for a fee, but can yield much greater
rewards.

Players who wish to purchase goods for later resale describe what
Ability they are using via the Primary Rule to acquire or transport
the cargo; for a ship, the Ability will generally be something like
Cargo Bays, Passenger Cabins, Smuggler's Hidey-hole, Cryostasis Chambers,
or the like. Players can Combine other Abilities such as Merchant
or Streetwise Shticks to improve the roll, though they need to narrate
how that's plausible (Streetwise, for instance, suggests they're engaged
in transporting something shady). As with Shipping, the WP for Trade
will be on the same Scope as the Ability that's used to justify engaging
in Trade. Once a particular Ability is used for Trade, it's treated
as Hindered for that purpose if you wish to use it again before selling
the goods; once it's been used twice, it's no longer available. Essentially,
each time you take on some cargo, that Cargo Bay (or whatever is being
used) is roughly half-full; subsequent cargoes will have to fit in
the remaining space, and once it's approximately full, you have to
get rid of some cargo before you can take on more.

The players then decide how valuable a cargo they want to acquire,
by choosing the PL of the cargo. They roll their chosen Ability, plus
any help from Combining, vs. the PL of the cargo; if they beat the
cargo's PL, then some is available for sale. The asking price is the
*lower* of the cargo's two die rolls: i.e. if the cargo is rolling
d6 and d4, and the d6 comes up 3 and the d4 comes up 4, the asking
price is 3. If the players find that acceptable, they've taken on
the cargo, and they record the cargo and the price they paid. Whether
the succeed, fail, or they don't like the asking price, the presumption
is that they've explored their options and there are no better deals
to be had; they must either travel elsewhere or spend **3** Scenes
on unrelated matters before they can try again.

The characters must always sell cargoes some place other than where
they picked them up. When they want to sell, they roll *the cargo's*
Power Level vs. the roll of the Wealth Level of the locale set by
the GM. If they beat that Wealth roll, then they find a buyer for
that cargo, and the Wealth roll is the best offer they've gotten.
If that is acceptable to them, they unload the cargo, and the profit
(or loss) is WP equal to the difference between that sale price and
their previously recorded purchase price. If they don't have WP to
cover the loss and still want the trade, for instance because they've
been trying to unload it forever without success and they really need
the space back, their Wealth Level is knocked down by 1. Again, the
presumption is that's the best deal they have for selling any of their
cargo in that location, and they will have to travel elsewhere or
spend 3 Scenes on unrelated matters before attempting to sell another
cargo, or that cargo again if they didn't like the offer.

What this boils down to is that really valuable (high PL) cargoes
are easy to find buyers for, but poor locations (low WL) won't be
able to offer very much wealth for them. Wealthy locations will tend
to purchase cargo at a much higher price, but because they're wealthy
it will be harder to sell them cheap (low PL) goods.

#### Example

Star Trader Falk wants to see if he can pick up some cargo on Ytter.
He has a trade-ship with Cargo Bays 7. He'd like to get something
he can sell quickly, so he doesn't want to try for too expensive a
cargo, both because it might not be available and it might be too
hard to unload at a good price in this relatively poor section of
the frontier, so he announces he wants to pick up a cargo of PL 4
Ytterian otterlusk furs, using his Cargo Bay and aiding it with his
Merchant Shtick. (He just made up otterlusks and the value of their
fur, as part of the Primary Rule.) He rolls a d8, d6 and gets a 3
+1 for Merchant, totaling 4. The otterlusk furs roll a d4, d4 and
get a 4 and a 4, so he can pick them up at price 4. That's higher
than ideal, since he'll need the purchaser to roll higher than 4 to
make a profit, so he passes.

He spends the next 3 Scenes making repairs on the ship's sensors,
getting in a poker match in a saloon, and training with his crew,
and decides to try one more deal before giving up and leaving the
planet with empty holds. He tries for a cargo of exotic hardwood PL
5 this time, using the same powers and shticks, and rolls a 2, +1
for 3. Fortunately the hardwood cargo rolls a 2 and a 1, so he gets
it for a bargain price.

After traveling to nearby Klopor for reasons having to do with the
adventure they're on, he tries to unload the cargo. The GM rules that
Klopor is a Wealth 4 planet. He rolls the cargo's PL of 5, and gets
a 5, +1 for Merchant, for a total of 6. The Kloporians will definitely
want that cargo (since they can't possibly roll higher than that),
but how much will they offer? The GM rolls a 2 for the Kloporians.
That would be only 1 WP profit (selling price of 2 - purchase price
back on Ytter of 1), so Falk refuses the deal. Having purchased it
for 1, he's sure he can do better.

Since he still has room in the Cargo Bay, he decides to try to take
on another cargo. He announces he's trying to get some Kloporian machine
parts at PL 6. Since the ship's Cargo Bay power is Hindered by being
partially full of hardwood, it will only roll a single d6, plus +1
for Falk's Merchant Shtick. He gets Xark, the ship's engineer, to
Combine his Engineering Power with the roll, since Engineers understand
machines. They roll a 4 +1 +1, for a total of 6. The machine parts
cargo will definitely be available, but for how much? The GM rolls
a 6 and a 2\... just barely available, but at a decent price. Falk
takes on the cargo, and now the Cargo Bays are full; if he wants to
do more Trading he'll have to use a different ship's Power or unload
one of the cargo's first.

Next stop on the adventure is the wealthy planet Hopalong (Wealth
8). It'll be harder for their PL 5 cargo to beat that, so another
player's character, Vira, offers to aid using her Streetwise Shtick
for another +1, saying the importation of hardwoods faces a high tariff
so they try the black market. Falk rolls a 5 for the cargo, +1 for
Merchant, +1 for Vira's Streetwise, totaling 7. The GM rolls a d8,
d8, and gets a 6 for the Hopalong buyers. Falk takes the deal, and
makes a profit of 5 WP, halfway to the next Wealth Level! The WP are
at the ship's Scope, since it's the ship's Cargo Bay power that was
being used.

He wants to unload the Machine Parts, too, so they spend another 3
Scenes on Hopalong, but using the Machine Parts cargo PL 6 only rolls
a 1 +1 +1 (using his Merchant and Xark's Engineering to help again)
for a 3; Hopalong rolls a 6, and the wealthy residents turn up their
noses at the cargo. Falk and co. will have to try again somewhere
else\...

Game Mastering {#sec:GameMasteringPart}
==============

Campaign design
---------------

Unless you are running a one-shot, you need to think a little bit
about the overall structure of the campaign you want to run. Many
things can be filled in as you go along, but some decisions have to
be made before you begin.

### Setting

SF can cover a mind-boggling array of settings. Here are some of the
common ones:

-   Near-future Earth

-   Alternate Earth

-   Far Past Earth

-   Post-Apocalyptic Earth

-   Far Future Earth

-   Virtual Reality

-   Solar System

-   Local Stellar Neighborhood

-   Star Cluster

-   Galaxy

-   Universe

-   Multiverse

#### Hard vs Soft SF

"Hard" SF is science fiction that
makes a conscious effort to make the science and technology in the
story stick to what we know, or at least surmise, and tries to be
modest in its extrapolations. The resulting "hardness"
of the SF falls on a continuum: the less extrapolation and the more
established the science, the "harder"...
the farther out and more speculative, the "softer",
until at the far end of the spectrum you get "science
fantasy", which is essentially magic in technological
drag. Allowance is often made for implausible science needed to make
the story work, such as faster-than-light travel or time travel, but
even there "harder" SF deliberately
tries to reduce the number of impossibilities and often to disguise
the ones it has by at least cloaking it in not-yet-absolutely-disproved
speculative science. Sometimes that the whole point of the story:
what would it be like if everything we knew for a fact was still the
same, but easy and cheap teleportation was possible?

To make the SF in Zap! "harder"
you want to rein in a bit on what's regarded as plausible according
to the Primary Rule. This has to be a joint effort by all the players
and the GM if you want to run a Hard SF setting. You want to aim for
verisimilitude, not strict scientific accuracy, but quickly fix any
spots that the any of the players notice strain that verisimilitude.
Strive to make the explanations of the abilities and gadgets consistent
with each other and over time, and obey the principle "There Ain't
No Such Thing As A Free Lunch" so there are drawbacks and limitations
to every power. Make liberal use of Disadvantages such as Shots, Erratic,
Limited, and Side Effects. Be particularly generous interpreting abilities
that are used to understand science and engineering when they are
applied to new phenomena and alien technology, to emphasize the universality
of science and the ability of intelligent creatures to understand
the basic principles of the universe.

##### Reversing the Polarity

What if you don't want the SF to feel harder, but instead
want to make your game wilder, wackier, and more like Science Fantasy?
Simple: you just reverse all the above advice. Try to break verisimilitude
by emphasizing things we know aren't true, like air
in space, space being filled with "ether",
perhaps even fire being caused by "phlogiston";
if players notice any inconsistency or contradiction, don't
correct it, elaborate on it and invent some esoteric explanation for
it (which may become a feature of the setting); make the rules that
govern the setting arbitrary and vary from place to place or character
to character; make the technology and science deliver free lunches
to all, with equipment that inexplicably has no apparent trade off
between power and weight and never needs maintenance, medicine that
has no side-effects, generators that create unlimited clean energy
cheaply, perpetual motion machines, new elements with mysterious properties
such as anti-gravity; make the science and technology unfamiliar,
even it it's just renaming things to seem exotic such
as calling radio waves "etheric vibrations"
or telescopes "panopticons".

#### [\[subsec:Standard-SF-templates\]]{#subsec:Standard-SF-templates label="subsec:Standard-SF-templates"}Standard SF templates

One way you can shape the setting for your game is to decide which
kind of SF creatures are common enough to warrant a template for player
characters. As mentioned earlier, usually the templates are geared
for playable creature types, those that can at least interact with
humans and have recognizable goals and concerns. However, even creatures
normally alien beyond comprehension, such as hyper-intelligent shades
of blue, can have that aspect deemphasized to allow them as player
characters.

Start with this bare bones template, filling in the power descriptions:

### The Campaign {#sec:TheCampaign .unnumbered}

### Episodic Or Epic? {#sec:EpisodicOrEpic}

Each session can be a self-contained adventure,
or the whole campaign can be a single mega-adventure, or something
in between.

In an episodic style of campaign, each adventure has a clear beginning,
middle and end. There may be ongoing plot threads and themes from
episode to episode, but the major focus of the episode comes to a
definite conclusion, with the PC's immediate goal (explore the planet,
establish contact with the alien race, escape from the cataclysm,
carry off the robbery) accomplished even if their ultimate motivation
for going on adventures hasn't been resolved. Emphasis on episodes
can mesh well with players' often hectic schedules, particularly if
the episodes are short, one or two sessions each, since a particular
character's absence from the current adventure doesn't tend to need
much explanation or leave a huge hole in the plot. This makes episodic
games ideal back-ups for when you don't have a quorum of your regular
players, for when you have a guest player or two, or just a "pick
up" game.

On the other hand, if players prefer an epic style campaign, where
there is a single over-arching plot or antagonist and everything builds
to a big climax dealing with that, it's certainly possible. One thing
to watch out for, besides the usual issues of players feeling "rail-roaded"
and unable to affect the plot except in minor details, is making sure
that the epic won't be short-circuited by the players defeating the
Big Bad or otherwise resolving the driving issue of the campaign prematurely.

Unless you're cheating, if it's possible for the players to defeat
the Big Bad or solve the problem without using a "Plot Device",
then it's possible that can happen any time they encounter him or
work on a solution, including the first time in what was intended
to be the prelude. If you want an epic campaign without cheating in
favor of whatever is driving the plot you should make sure that the
players can't come to grips with the main enemy or issue until the
climax, for instance by arranging that it can only be finally resolved
with a Plot Device, that the resolution require visiting various sites,
or that the plot can roll merrily along even without the main driver
to guide it.

Examples:

-   The villain can reconstitute himself given time unless the virus has
    been uploaded into the Master System.

-   The expanding singularity that will engulf the galaxy can only be
    halted by detonating a device from within it, which the heroes have
    to embark on an epic quest to deliver.

-   Driving back the invaders will require diplomatic missions to all
    of the rival factions to get them on board, and they may have demands
    in return for cooperation that will in turn lead to adventures.

-   The enemy has set something in motion that his capture won't stop
    ("You may have defeated me, but the Sun Eater shall continue on
    a straight path through the inhabited galaxy regardless! Bwa ha ha
    ha!").

-   There is a lieutenant or secondary bad guy waiting in the wings to
    step in when the original instigator is dealt with.

-   The clever plan by which the heroes halted the initial problem has
    generated side-effects that need to be dealt with before the campaign
    is truly over.

Or, you could just deal with the anticlimax, allow the players to
have their triumph, and move on to the next arc. Many, perhaps even
most, players would prefer to have an unexpectedly short and successful
"epic" than be railroaded to a predetermined conclusion; just
because they'd love to blow up the Death Star doesn't necessarily
mean that they'll love it if you arbitrarily thwart their every attempt
to prevent its construction along the way in order to get to that
final scene.

It is also possible to combine the episodic and epic: have an epic
campaign in the big picture, leavened with one or two-session adventures
that relate tangentially or not at all to the over-arching plot. This
is the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" model of story arcs: over the
course of a "season" of twelve or even more sessions there is
a major enemy working towards a final Earth-shattering scheme, but
aside from a bit of foreshadowing in each episode the big scheme proceeds
in fits and starts while most of the adventures deal with largely
unrelated schemes by different bad guys. In fiction, the heroes may
be completely unaware of the presence of the chief bad guy of the
arc until it's time for the climax, with only the audience seeing
how step-by-step he gets closer to his goal; in an RPG that doesn't
work as well, unless the players are unusually open to having "cut
scenes" of out-of-character knowledge just for flavor. A better
model is for the heroes to be slowly acquiring the clues needed to
figure out the plot or pieces of the Plot Device to defeat the main
threat.

Designing an Adventure
----------------------

### What you need to design

An adventure is a problem that confronts the PCs. The problem might
be specific, concrete, and demand that something be done immediately
(there is an alien loose on the ship, and if it's not captured or
killed it will eat everybody's heads), or it might be vague and long-range
(the PCs need more information about what the factions are in Gamma
Quadrant before they can make any decision about alliances), but if
the PCs have no problems to solve, there's nothing to game and you
might as well advance the action until there *is* a problem that
needs their attention. It is usually better not to plan out a detailed
sequence of scenes to be played out in linear fashion, but instead
to invent a set of elements (aliens, people to talk to, clues, events,
special objects, secrets) that might be inserted when needed. The
rest of the section are guidelines with suggestions about which elements
to design. Feel free to use or ignore these as you feel fit.

### Adventure Arcs

Adventures are usually problems that need to be solved. Most adventures
will go through three stages: Exposition, Investigation, and Confrontation.
In the Exposition stage the PC's learn of a problem, and hopefully
decide to do something with that information, even if they don't know
exactly what yet. This is when the basic premise of the adventure
is laid out. In a television episode, this is typically the stuff
that happens before the opening credits, where we learn our intrepid
crew is on their way to Canopis IV carrying medical supplies to stop
an outbreak of the Denebian Plague. In a campaign that is designed
more around the PC's goals rather than a series of specific adventures,
the exposition stage might consist of nothing more than a brief list
of things the PC's activities have turned up that sound like they
might be of use towards those goals, or problems that have cropped
up that might interfere with them, allowing the players to decide
which they want to pursue first or if they care at all. "Production
is down at your robotic mining facility in Delta Sector, but the foreman
can't explain why; meanwhile the ambassador from the Outer Planets
is meeting with your arch-rival, the head of the Argus Conglomerate,
and the chief scientist of your wormhole project has reported they
are ready for a small-scale test."

Once the PC's have a goal, either invented, handed to them, or forced
on them by circumstances the Investigation stage begins. In this stage
they use their skills and resources to try to learn more about the
parameters of the problem or resources that might help them reach
their goal. In SF, investigation will often involve Research, either
as part of the scenes needed for a Scientist building a gadget to
address the problem, or to advance the PC's other goals.

Finally, there is the Confrontation stage, where it all comes together
and their immediate plans are resolved one way or the other. This
doesn't necessarily mean they reach their ultimate goal: in some campaigns
it may be impossible to reach that goal by design such as when the
campaign is about the five-year mission to explore strange new worlds,
or a rag-tag fleet of ships fleeing disaster and seeking the lost
home of humanity. Nevertheless, the intermediate goals, whether they
are episodes or campaign arcs, need to get resolved so the players
have some sense of forward momentum. Things might not always work
out as the PC's wanted. Depending on how things play out they might
be resolved with a set-back or disaster, a partial victory that leads
to further goals and adventures, or even a complete triumph for the
good guys. Part of the point of Zap! is let the players and GM be
surprised by exactly how things turn out. If the GM knows in advance
both what the climactic scene is going to look like and how it turns
out, it's too tightly plotted; it's important to leave plenty of freedom
for the players actions to matter to the outcome.

### Interleaving arcs

This sequence of exposition, investigation, and confrontation, which
we'll call an arc, can be a single session or multiple sessions. Not
every event needs to be related to the current arc. In addition, you
can have multiple arcs in play in a single session. One way to do
this is to weave the arcs together, with some of the exposition of
the next arc happening during the investigation of the previous arc.
You can also link some or all of the arcs together into a "seasonal
arc", with a whole adventure serving the same purpose of one scene
in the master arc for the season. For example, suppose the master
arc is about an expedition of unscrupulous explorers planning to excavate
a Precusor site. The first adventure could be the PC's crossing paths
with the explorers who are attempting to steal data from a PC or ally
of the PC's that they need to located the site. Thus, the whole adventure
serves as the exposition segment of the master arc, with the purpose
that the PC's learn of the explorers and their theft of data, but
not the purpose of the intended theft.

![image](Battle01.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

### Failure is always an option. Success is always an option

Whenever you plan for an encounter, never assume that the players
will succeed or that they will fail. For example, don't plan an adventure
with the assumption that the explorers will steal the data from the
players, because they might succeed at stopping the theft. On the
other hand, don't make the adventure contingent on the players capturing
a thief, because they may not succeed at capturing her, or they may
decide to kill her, or make a deal with her. Better is to say, "The
explorers will attempt to steal the data from the players" and make
a plan for further encounters whether or not the theft succeeds. If
you really need the data stolen, it is better to have it be stolen
before the adventure even begins. It is unfair, but at least you're
not trying to fool your players into thinking it was their fault.

### The End of The World is not the end of the world

Allowing for the possibility of failure does not mean the stakes cannot
be high. What is a complete disaster from the player character's point
of view can be an invigorating change of pace for the campaign. In
a science fiction game even death is often reversible, either literally
or with the possibility of returning as a clone, VR personality, or
alternate universe version. If the explorers succeed at opening the
Precursor site and reactivating the Cyborgmen, the next few arcs can
be the players gathering information and completing a weapon capable
of deactivating the Cyborgmen, pursued by them and their ever-growing
army of creatures they've cyborged. Even if the whole world is converted
to Cyborgmen colony, this opens up new drama as the players become
part of a resistance movement, fighting the new order. Failure should
have consequences, but the aftermath of failure should be a new adventure,
not just instant obliteration.

Plot Templates
--------------

While there's a variety of creatures, local color, and fantastic features
in science fiction, many of the basic plots are in standardized patterns.
The following sample plots are meant to provide some structure that
you can incorporate your creative ideas onto, not as a substitute
for your creativity.

Each standard plot outlines some possibilities for Introduction scenes,
sub-goals that both the players and enemies will pursue in Investigation,
and how final Confrontations might play out depending on whether the
player or their foes seem to have the upper hand during the investigation
phase, some Twists that can be added to the standard plots to make
them less predictable or more meaningful to the players and the Aftermath,
suggesting what happens after the Confrontation, especially if the
player characters lose.

### Altered Reality {#altered-reality .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The status quo has been dramatically changed.
    Maybe a time traveler has stopped Julius Caesar's assassination, and
    the Roman Empire continues to the current day.

Special:

:   An altered reality arc can be a mini-campaign within
    the campaign. It is best to have some time to think and prepare before
    starting. If a world-changing event happens unexpectedly in a session,
    it is good to end the session then and let both players and GM think
    through the consequences. The campaign and PCs may require a total
    redesign. New standard creature templates may be called for, either
    to replace existing ones (e.g., robots may have a very different template
    in a world without technology) or to reflect new possibilities (e..g,
    every normal human may have gained a distinct superpower). The scope
    of the campaign may change in the new reality, usually increasing.
    For example, the PCs may become godlike beings, or have one-time access
    to a powerful creature. One possibility is to issue new guidelines
    and allow total redesign of player characters for the arc. Players
    may choose to play a new character or almost unrecognizable version
    of their existing character. Existing villains may become the PCs
    and the existing PCs villains or NPCs, e.g., the altered history on
    Buffy where Willow had become a vampire and turned many of the Scooby
    gang. In any case, give XP to the player, not the character.

Introductory scenes:

:   Skip ahead beyond the change. Start with
    "slice of life" scenes under the new regime. How are the PCs adapting,
    how are they altered? The PCs then meet and get reacquainted (or
    perhaps meet for the first time.) Finally, they start getting clues
    that it might be possible to reverse the change. (This may require
    them to realize there's been a change.)

Sub-goals and confrontation scenes:

:   Once the PCs decide to
    reverse the change (if they do), the rest of the arc consists of the
    PCs first figuring out what is necessary to reverse the change, which
    may involve investigating what caused it in the first place. The PCs
    may need to compile the equipment for a device or experiment to revert
    to the original status quo, while the enemy is trying to stop them.
    The confrontation scene happens just before or after they complete
    the set-up.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players have figured out
    what they need to do to restore reality and have completed the necessary
    preparations; all that remains is to go through the process, and their
    foes have a limited window of opportunity to stop them.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The players are still missing
    a crucial component or piece of information needed to ensure success,
    but they're out of time and the foes are in a position to attempt
    to stop them for good. The PCs may have to go ahead with the flawed
    uncertain process or risk being unable to ever restore reality, or
    perhaps will only be able to do so at greatly increased cost to themselves.

Twists:

:   The *status quo* the players are familiar with is
    actually the result of a previous reality alteration. What if Rome
    only fell in the first place because of intervention by a time traveler?
    Ought the PCs oppose or aid in attempts to restore the prior reality?
    How much do they know about what it was like before, and what duty
    do they owe the people in the current reality who might find themselves
    worse off or cease to exist if the time-line is restored?

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, the change is reversed. The world
    returns to the *status quo ante*. Perhaps it is retroactive;
    the change never happened as far as most are concerned. Or perhaps
    the memory of the change leads to permanent changes in the status
    quo, shifting of alliances, or creation of laws and enforcement organizations
    to prevent such changes in the future (e.g. Time Police). If the
    PCs fail, they or other characters can try again, with a different
    approach.

### Back in Time {#back-in-time .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs travel back in time, voluntarily or not,
    and have to find a way to return to their own time. If voluntary,
    they may have a mission to perform first.

Introductory scenes:

:   The PCs uncover the means to travel back
    in time, a reason to do so, or are just thrust willy-nilly back by
    some phenomenon, alien artifact, or device gone awry.

PC sub-goals:

:   Uncover the means to return to their own time;
    accomplish their mission if they must do that first; reverse whatever
    disruption to the time-line they may have caused upon arrival.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If this was a plot by enemies, prevent the
    PCs from accomplishing their mission or returning; otherwise they
    may encounter new enemies in the past who are trying to capture or
    stop them for reasons of their own, perhaps not even knowing they
    are time travelers.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have accomplished their
    mission or gathered the information/built the equipment necessary
    to return. Now they need the right conditions or the right time to
    activate it.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have failed in their
    primary mission, but to stay to accomplish it is to risk being trapped
    or having the secret of time travel fall into the wrong hands.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, they are back when they came from
    and the time line is as intended (including any changes they went
    back to accomplish); if they failed then either they're back but the
    time-line is not as they wished, or even worse than when they set
    out, or they remain trapped in the past.

Twists:

:   The PCs travel forward in time; there they may find out
    information about the future that makes it imperative they return
    to their original time and prevent that future from happening, or
    they may decide they like it better and not return. Relativistic time
    dilation and cryogenics are also common one-way tickets to the future
    in SF.

### Creature Feature {#creature-feature .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   A creature is rampaging. While the creature could
    be a mindless hulk or a super-intelligent alien, it has a overwhelming
    need that drives it to repetitive violence. The creature will strike
    again and again until it is stopped, presumably by the PCs.

Introductory scenes:

:   Viewing carnage from the creature's rampage;
    hearing about same on the news; helping a victim escape; being called
    in as experts by authorities.

PC sub-goals:

:   Identify creature. Interview experts on creatures
    of that type. Discover their weaknesses and drives. Rescue hostages
    and potential victims. Recruit allies equipped to handle these creatures.
    Track creature to lair.

Enemy[ sub-goals]{.smallcaps}:

:   Rampage. As the creature escalates the
    violence, it forces the PCs to confront it before they are ready,
    or be responsible for its destruction continuing. Capture hostages.
    Feed and grow stronger.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players know about this
    creature, what urges cause it to rampage, what it wants, and what
    its vulnerabilities are. They free the hostages, then use their knowledge
    to lure the creature into a trap.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   At its strongest, the creature
    strikes in a way the PCs cannot ignore, perhaps threatening their
    families, friends, or homes. The PCs fight the creature, but are distracted
    by the need to help the innocent victims being threatened.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs win, the creature is usually destroyed
    or neutralized, and the next session will start a new, unrelated arc.
    If the PCs lose, the creature may get stronger and attack again, so
    the next session would be a continuation, perhaps with more twists,
    as potential allies are recruited to help and enemies try to take
    advantage of the chaos caused by the creature.

Twists:

:   Scooby-doo: "Creature" is a ruse, to cover a more
    mundane scheme. Creature is sympathetic, e.g, the Hulk. Creature has
    a sympathetic alter ego, e.g., the Lizard from Spider-man. Creature
    targets unsympathetic victims, e.g., is driven by justified vengeance.
    Creature targets PCs, or those connected to PCs. Creature gains strength
    from successful feedings. Creature is sophisticated, and lures victims
    with psychological traps rather than brute strength. Creature hypnotizes
    or transmutes victims into monstrous accomplices.

### First Contact {#first-contact .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   Initial contact with an alien, or an entire alien
    culture. This could be the first such contact ever, or part of the
    PC's job as xeno-contact specialists; if the the latter, there should
    be some complication or difficulty that makes it an adventure rather
    than a day at the office.

Special:

:   First contact can for the basis for an entire campaign,
    either as one overarching set of adventures dealing with coming into
    contact with the aliens, figuring out how to communicate with them,
    overcoming misunderstandings or physical difficulties in sharing space,
    finding common ground and establishing ongoing relations. In this
    kind of campaign, the GM should probably work out a lot of details
    about the aliens and their goals in advance, even though none of this
    information will be apparent to the PCs for a long time, if ever.
    Alternatively, a first contact campaign can deal with a new contact
    each week, allowing the players to continue to meet new and different
    alien cultures and solve a variety of problems as they seek out new
    life and new civilizations, in which case the GM merely has to make
    up enough for the next episode.

Introductory scenes:

:   Receiving an alien signal, getting called
    in to investigate mysterious phenomena which turn out to be caused
    by aliens, finding evidence of ancient aliens that gives a clue into
    establishing or re-establishing contact.

PC sub-goals:

:   Discover more about the aliens, determine whether
    they are hostile, establish relations, prevent the PC's enemies from
    taking advantage of the aliens.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   if the aliens are hostile discover more about
    the PCs and their weaknesses, if the aliens are friendly the PC's
    enemies might be trying to exploit them or recruit them as allies
    against the PCs.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players know what the aliens
    are and how to communicate with them, or what their weaknesses are
    if they're hostile.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   Hostile aliens know about the
    PCs and what their weaknesses are; friendly aliens have been duped
    into regarding the PCs as hostile.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs win hostile aliens have been destroyed,
    neutralized or made friends with, or the PC's enemies' machinations
    have been exposed for what they are. If the PCs lose the aliens have
    gained the upper hand, and perhaps invaded; the PC's enemies have
    made an alliance with the aliens and the PCs will have to face them
    as a combined force in the future.

Twists:

:   The PCs are the aliens, isolated from their own culture
    and allies. The aliens are actually a hoax. Apparently friendly aliens
    are actually hostile, or vice-versa.

### Great Race {#great-race .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The characters become involved in a race, often
    against multiple other competitors. Sometimes this is purely a sporting
    proposition, at other times there is something larger at stake, possibly
    up to and including the fate of the universe.

Special:

:   A great race scenario can be a good way to visit a lot
    of different locales in the setting, without spending a lot of time
    in each, so the GM should probably have enough interesting places
    and incidents work out in advance so that the PCs can visit more than
    one a session without having to stop or wing it.

Introductory scenes:

:   A race is announced, with a prize sufficient
    to tempt the PCs, or they come across some information that means
    they need to outrun a bunch of competitors.

PC sub-goals:

:   Gain an advantage in the race by discovering information
    leading to shortcuts, improving their vehicle, avoiding obstacles
    and hostile forces. Unscrupulous PCs may try to sabotage the competitors
    or throw obstacles in their way.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Same as the PCs.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players are in a superior
    position as it comes to the end of the race and need to hold on to
    their lead.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The enemies are in a superior
    position and the players must come up with some way to overtake them.

Aftermath:

:   The players can enjoy their prize and notoriety, if
    it was a sporting event, and it can be a stepping-stone to further
    such events. If the "race" was for higher stakes, such as recovery
    and mastery of some unique alien technology, further adventures can
    revolve around the PCs using that technology and others trying to
    wrest it from them. If the PCs lose, they can plot their come-back,
    if it was a sporting event, or deal with the repercussions of their
    enemies having whatever it is they were racing for.

Twists:

:   What appears to be a sporting event turns out to have
    a deeper significance, which only begins to be revealed to the PCs
    when their opponents are going to greater lengths to win than the
    prize would warrant. The race is to stay ahead of some cataclysmic
    event or invading alien horde.

### Marooned {#marooned .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs are stranded somewhere, cut off from
    civilization and without their normal means of transportation. They
    need to somehow get new means of transportation, get to somewhere
    where they can re-establish contact, or even in extreme scenarios
    find some way to settle in and build an new life in the new locale.
    Marooned can form the basis of an entire campaign if the PCs are marooned
    on a backwater planet or hiding from powerful enemies, or in a new
    dimension or time. E.T., Lost, Sliders and Quantum Leap all follow
    this format.

Special:

:   because the PCs may spend a lot of time in the new location,
    it probably needs more detail than a typical planet-side stop. In
    addition, the GM should probably consider and perhaps consult with
    the players whether they're actually interested in the scenario; if
    the players' chief enjoyment is hopping from place to place encountering
    new settings every session, wrecking their ship and sticking them
    on a primitive backwater may feel like a punishment instead of an
    adventure. The GM should be prepared to wrap things up quickly, and
    get the PCs back to doing what they're interested in.

Introductory scenes:

:   A disaster strikes, and the PCs are forced
    into the new locale and possibly stripped of the vehicle and much
    of the standard gear.

PC sub-goals:

:   Discover information about where they are and
    what resources they have to escape or restore contact. Survive, establish
    relationships with locals who might be able to help.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   There may not be actual enemies; if there are
    and they're responsible for the PCs being marooned, they may be trying
    to find the PCs to finish the job. The PCs might also make enemies
    among the locals.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have survived, figured
    out where they are and how to get away, and have a shot at doing so.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   If there are enemies responsible
    for the PCs predicament, they have located the PCs and are poised
    to deliver a set-back, such as capturing them or ruining their current
    rescue plan.

Aftermath:

:   The PCs succeed in getting rescued or back to their
    usual haunts; if there were enemies responsible, they can decide to
    take action against them, otherwise they might just return to their
    normal adventures. If they lost their ship, they might have to work
    to get a new one. If the enemies succeeded the PCs may need to escape
    from captivity or come up with another plan, or resign themselves
    to their new home.

Twists:

:   The location where the PCs are Marooned is not what they
    thought it was (e.g. actually a resort area, and they were close to
    rescue all along, or they are unwitting contestants in a game of some
    sort).

### Mayday {#mayday .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs receive a distress signal, and have to
    deal with it.

Introductory scenes:

:   They receive the distress signal, and decide
    what to do about it.

PC sub-goals:

:   Gain information about the sender and the situation,
    establish contact with any survivors, rescue the survivors, avoid
    whatever it was that caused the situation in the first place.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If there's an actual enemy, complete the piracy,
    kidnap, robbery or invasion that prompted the distress signal, get
    information about the PCs, their plans and resources.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players have enough information
    that they can attempt the rescue or to defeat the enemy.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The enemy are about to finish
    their work and get away, e.g. they've located the executive they sabotaged
    the ship so they could board and kidnap. They have identified the
    PCs and where they are well enough to plan an ambush.

Aftermath:

:   If successful, the PCs could have the gratitude of
    those they've rescued, leading to offers of work; they might have
    salvaged some valuable gear or even an adventure-triggering MacGuffin.
    If not, the PCs may need to repair their ship and recover from losses,
    or to track down and pursue the enemies who have accomplished their
    objective.

Special:

:   A MacGuffin that either caused or was the target of
    whatever caused the distress signal can be a springboard for further
    adventures.

Twists:

:   It's a trap, or the distress signal is extremely old,
    and when the PCs arrive the situation is not what they expected. This
    could be everybody is dead but there's some horrible monster (Alien),
    but it could also be the descendants of the survivors have settled
    the locale and aren't in direct need of rescue\...or they are, but
    it's logistically difficult because of their numbers or the fact that
    they've regressed to savagery and don't understand what's at stake
    (e.g. their colony ship is heading for the sun).

### Mirror World {#mirror-world .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs are projected into an alternate universe
    where things are backwards; usually the morality of the organizations
    and people are reversed, though there may be additional reversals
    such as the sex or personalities of some or all of the characters
    (e.g. a cold, logical being might have a hot-tempered and excitable
    "mirror twin").

Introductory scenes:

:   The accident or experiment where the PCs
    enter the mirror world; first meeting the mirror world counterparts
    and figuring out that's what they are.

PC sub-goals:

:   Learn enough to be able to pass for mirror world
    inhabitants while they figure out how to get home; figure out how
    to get home.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Learn that the PCs aren't the people they're
    pretending to be, learn where they came from and how, figure out how
    to exploit that.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs learn enough to return
    to their own world, and accomplish their goals if any in the mirror
    world.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs are exposed and the enemies
    are prepared to capture them or exploit the fact they're not their
    counterparts, or the enemies are ready to enter the PCs world.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, they get back home. One or more
    of the PCs may be accompanied or replaced by a mirror world double.
    If the PCs failed, they are either stuck in the mirror world and need
    to try again or make do, or they may be back in their own world but
    have to hunt down and deal with mirror world enemies who've also come
    over; these may be duplicates of the PCs, or their allies, or important
    NPCs in the PCs' world.

Twists:

:   It's the mirror universe twins who come visiting the
    PC's universe.

### Negative Space Wedgie {#negative-space-wedgie .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs encounter a strange anomaly (in the parlance
    of TV Tropes, a "Negative Space Wedgie", from a scene in the parody
    *Star Drek*) that creates a crisis they must deal with. Often
    the anomaly does something completely bizarre and magical, even in
    settings which otherwise adhere to relatively plausible science. PCs
    might encounter future selves, age incredibly quickly, or be de-aged,
    be transported to a far quadrant of the galaxy, etc.

Introductory scenes:

:   The PCs detect the anomaly; they may decide
    to investigate, or be suddenly subjected to it.

PC sub-goals:

:   Determine the exact nature of the anomaly, or
    at least how to avoid or reverse its effects. Discover a way to use
    the anomaly to address some other problem they have been having. Simply
    deal with or survive the more extreme effects.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Anomalies don't usually involve overt enemies.
    If they do, they are the backdrop against which the enemy is confronted:
    e.g. the PCs and an enemy warship both get sucked into an anomaly
    and shot across the galaxy: in order to return to their own sector
    they must come to an accommodation of some sort.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs learn enough to ameliorate
    or reverse the anomaly and safely escape. Otherwise escape might occur
    without them being able to reverse the effects.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs are successful there usually aren't any
    long term consequences, though if the anomaly is stable and they understand
    it, they might find a use for it in the future; if they weren't successful
    in dealing with the anomaly they might have to live with or seek a
    cure for whatever effects the anomaly visited upon them.

Special:

:   Negative Space Wedgies might kick off a campaign, for
    instance leading to a marooned scenario, or granting the PCs strange
    powers that sets up the campaign.

Twists:

:   Almost anything goes.

### War Zone {#war-zone .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   Open hostilities have broken out between two
    or more factions in the setting. The PCs are caught in the middle.
    They may be recruited as allies by one or more sides, or just seek
    to minimize the collateral damage.

Introductory scenes:

:   PCs hear word of tension between the factions.
    The PCs encounter a battlefield, either during or after the fight.
    The sides either court the PCs or warn them against siding against
    them.

PC sub-goals:

:   The PCs may decide to root for one side to win,
    they may decide to try to end the conflict, or they might just try
    to keep it out of the way of innocents. In any case, the PCs will
    investigate the causes of the conflict, try to determine what each
    side wants and what they will settle for, and try to talk neutral
    factions into co-operating with the PCs goals.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If the PCs take sides, the other faction will
    try to neutralize or eliminate them. If they stay neutral, the two
    sides may try to recruit them or scare them away. Both sides will
    try to weaken their adversaries, gain special weapons, and recruit
    powerful allies.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   Having assembled an alliance
    against the aggressor, the PCs lure them into a battle in a remote
    location. Alternatively, the PCs manage to address both sides concerns
    and stop the final battle before it begins.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have joined the losing
    side. A vast alliance is assembled against them and their weakened
    faction. They make a desperate last stand, outnumbered. Or their attempts
    to bring peace have back-fired, and the two factions unite against
    the PCs.

Aftermath:

:   The losing faction may be weakened or eliminated.
    The winners may be strengthened or they may also be weakened. Third
    party factions may try to take advantage of a power vacuum.

Twists:

:   PCs have mixed loyalties, with some rooting for one side
    and others the other. A third party is responsible for stirring up
    tension between the warring factions, and will use the war as a distraction
    covering its own plans.
