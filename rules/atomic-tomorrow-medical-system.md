# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: MEDICAL SYSTEM

## CORE WOUND MECHANICS

### DURING COMBAT & IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH

- Characters can sustain up to 3 wounds with no mechanical penalties
- This represents adrenaline, training, and determination overcoming injury
- Reaching 4+ wounds = Incapacitation (character cannot act)

### POST-COMBAT & RECOVERY PHASE

- Wounds manifest penalties once the "adrenaline phase" ends (10-30 minutes after combat)
- Without medical intervention, each wound imposes a cumulative -20% penalty
- "You should be in bed, ya dope!" = Mechanical representation of pushing through injury

## INJURY SPECIFICATION SYSTEM

When a character receives a wound during gameplay:

1. Note the **cause of injury** (already known from gameplay)
2. Note the **location** (determined during combat or specified retroactively)
3. Roll percentile dice to determine **specific complications**

### WOUND LOCATION CHART

Location can be determined using the ones digit of the attack roll, or specified during narration:

| Digit | Location                 |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| 1-2   | Head/Neck                |
| 3-4   | Torso                    |
| 5-6   | Arms                     |
| 7-8   | Legs                     |
| 9-0   | Extremities (hands/feet) |

### WOUND SPECIFICATION TABLE (BY DAMAGE TYPE)

*(Tables remain unchanged)*

## TREATMENT OPTIONS

### TRAUMA TREATMENTS (For Kinetic/Penetrating Wounds)

## MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS

### IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS

These occur during or immediately after treatment:

#### TREATMENT REACTION RULES

When administering any treatment, the physician must make a Medicine skill check (using the appropriate specialization):

- **Success**: Treatment works as expected with no complications
- **Failure**: Minor Reaction - Mild discomfort, no mechanical effect
- **Special Failure** (roll ending in 0 or 5): Moderate Reaction - Patient experiences -20% to all actions until medicine check success, 1 check per hour
- **Critical Failure** (doubles over skill): Severe Reaction - Treatment effectiveness reduced by half

If a severe reaction occurs, the patient makes a GRIT check:

- **Success**: Reaction remains at Severe level
- **Failure**: Critical Reaction - Treatment fails completely; patient cannot receive same treatment again

### POST-RECOVERY COMPLICATIONS

These develop after treatment appears successful:

After any treatment, the physician makes a Medicine check. On failure, roll on the Long-Term Complication table:

#### LONG-TERM COMPLICATION TABLE (Roll percentile dice)

| Roll % | Complication Type                | Effect                                                                                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 61-70  | **Neural Adaptation**      | Treatment becomes half as effective with each subsequent use on this patient                               |
| 71-80  | **Psychological Trauma**   | NERVE check when in similar situations to when injury occurred or experience flashbacks                  |
| 81-90  | **Secondary Condition**    | Develops related medical condition requiring ongoing management (referee's choice based on injury)         |
| 91-95  | **Mysterious Symptoms**    | Strange effects with no clear cause (glowing under certain light, unusual sensitivity, etc.)               |
| 96-00  | **Beneficial Mutation**    | Injury site develops unusual beneficial property (enhanced sensory perception, increased resilience, etc.) |

### STACKED TREATMENTS COMPLICATIONS

When multiple treatments are applied to the same patient:

#### TREATMENT INTERACTION RULES

The physician must make a Medicine (Pharmacology) check with a cumulative -20% penalty for each treatment already active:

- **Success**: No interaction (treatments function independently)
- **Failure**: Diminished Effect - Each treatment operates at 75% effectiveness
- **Special Failure**: Systemic Stress - Patient suffers -20% to all checks for 24 hours
- **Critical Failure**: Dangerous Interaction - Physician must make an immediate Medicine (Emergency) check or patient suffers an additional wound

### SPECIFIC MEDICATION EFFECTS

#### STIMULANT DEPENDENCY

For each consecutive use of stim-shots within 72 hours:

- First use: Standard effects
- Second use: Patient must make a NERVE check to avoid dependency
- Third+ use: Patient must make a NERVE check at -20% to avoid dependency
- Effect: Patient suffers -40% to all actions when not under stimulant effect
- Recovery: Requires 1 week detox under medical supervision

### MUTATION TABLE

When a patient fails their GRIT check after Z-Ray treatment, roll percentile dice:

| Roll % | Mutation Type                   | Effect                                                                                    |

| 21-40  | **Enhanced Healing**      | Wounds in affected area heal 50% faster                                                   |
| 41-60  | **Sensory Shift**         | Heightened sense (touch, smell, etc.) but overstimulation risk                            |
| 61-75  | **Tissue Hardening**      | +1 armor at affected site, but reduced flexibility (-20% to fine manipulation)            |
| 76-85  | **Energy Sensitivity**    | Can detect energy fields, but suffers double damage from energy weapons                   |
| 86-95  | **Adaptive Tissue**       | Environmental resistance at affected site, but unusual appearance                         |
| 96-00  | **Radical Alteration**    | Major beneficial mutation with significant physical change (referee determines specifics) |
