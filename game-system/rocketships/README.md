## Manuscript Integration

This content maps to **Volume I - Explorer's Manual** (Basic Spacecraft section) and **Volume II - Operations Manual** (detailed space rules). Suggested integration order:

### Volume I (Basic Space Travel)
1. Simple spacecraft rules for players
2. Basic rocketship catalog (common vessels)
3. Essential space hazards

### Volume II (Advanced Space Operations)
1. Complete rocketship catalog
2. Detailed space combat rules
3. Comprehensive space hazards
4. Ship complications and quirks systems

## Notes for Manuscript Development

- Ensure spacecraft stats integrate with core mechanics
- Verify space combat rules work with standard combat system
- Check that space hazards create meaningful gameplay challenges
- Consider how spacecraft costs relate to equipment pricing
- Ensure retro-futuristic aesthetic is maintained in ship designs
- Cross-reference with orbital distance table from core rules
- Verify complications system provides interesting narrative opportunities
