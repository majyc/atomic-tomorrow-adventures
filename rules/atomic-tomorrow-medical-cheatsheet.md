# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## FIELD MEDIC'S EMERGENCY REFERENCE

### QUICK REFERENCE: COMBAT WOUNDS

- Characters sustain wounds with **NO PENALTIES** during combat (adrenaline effect)
- Penalties (-20% per wound) only apply 10-30 minutes after combat ends
- At 4+ wounds, character is **INCAPACITATED** regardless of adrenaline

### EMERGENCY MEDICATIONS

| Medication | Primary Effect | Side Effect | Duration | Best For |
|------------|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Kermitomine** | Removes ALL wound penalties | Unconsciousness + GRIT×5 check when expires or suffer additional wound; 20% chance of spasms | 1d10 turns | Critical combat situations requiring immediate action |
| **Aplombium** | Functions despite wounds at -20% to all actions | Masks worsening symptoms | 24 hours | Long-duration missions where crash would be dangerous |
| **Stim-Shot** | Removes ALL wound penalties | -40% penalty for 2hrs after 6hr duration; second dose risks unconsciousness | 6 hours | Medium-length operations with recovery time after |
| **Psychotropic Analgesic** | Redirect penalties to chosen attributes | Double penalties to selected attributes; 30% chance of hallucinations | 12 hours | Situations requiring specific abilities at full function |

### TRAUMA TREATMENTS (BLUNT/PENETRATING)

| Treatment | Best For | Not For | Side Effect |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Bone-Knit Gel** | Fractures | Soft tissue injuries | 20% chance of pain flare-up during stress |
| **Vascular Sealant** | Bleeding wounds | Non-bleeding injuries | -20% to fine manipulation of affected area |
| **Trauma Pak** | General injuries | Doesn't fully heal | Requires 1hr rest afterward |

### ENERGY DAMAGE TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Best For | Not For | Side Effect |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Coolant Spray** | Fresh burns | Old/infected burns | -20% to flexibility in area |
| **Bioelectric Stabilizer** | Nerve disruption | Tissue damage | 20% chance of action failure in precision tasks |
| **Z-Ray Reconstruction** | Severe energy damage | Don't use repeatedly | 20% chance of mutation per treatment |

### TOXIC/ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENTS

| Treatment | Best For | Not For | Side Effect |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Universal Antitoxin** | Most poisons | Radiation | 20% chance of illness in next 48hrs |
| **Radiation Purge** | Radiation exposure | Other toxins | -40% to BRAWN checks for 24hrs |
| **Atmospheric Adaptor** | Environmental hazards | Acute poisoning | Requires 20% more nutrition |

### TRIAGE DECISION TREE

1. **Is patient incapacitated (4+ wounds)?**
   - YES → Surgical Intervention or Z-Ray (if available), otherwise Suspended Animation
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Is immediate full function required?**
   - YES → Kermitomine (short-term) or Stim-Shot (medium-term)
   - NO → Continue to step 3

3. **What is injury type?**
   - BLUNT/PENETRATING → Trauma Pak or specific trauma treatment
   - ENERGY → Appropriate energy treatment
   - TOXIC/ENVIRONMENTAL → Appropriate toxin treatment
   - MIXED → Aplombium (safest general option)

4. **How long until proper medical facilities?**
   - <6 HOURS → Stim-Shot (if full function needed)
   - 6-24 HOURS → Aplombium
   - >24 HOURS → Trauma-specific treatment + plan for complication management

### COMMON COMPLICATIONS

| Complication | Chance | Prevention | Management |
|--------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Treatment Reaction | 30% | Medical specialist | Reduce severity by one level with quick intervention |
| Long-Term Complication | 20% per treatment | Minimize treatments | Various based on specific complication |
| Treatment Interaction | 40% when using multiple | Use compatible treatments | Emergency medical intervention if severe |
| Stimulant Dependency | 20% for 2nd use | Wait 72hrs between uses | 1 week detox required |
| Z-Ray Mutation | 20% per treatment | Limit to 2 treatments max | Some beneficial; suppression medication for harmful |

### MEDICAL SPECIALIST ADVANTAGES

- **EMERGENCY MEDICINE**: Half MSU cost; 30% chance to prevent stimulant crash
- **SURGEON**: Faster surgery recovery; better results with limited facilities
- **XENOMEDICINE**: Effective on non-humans; can guide mutations positively
- **FIELD MEDIC**: Can treat during combat; 40% chance to save supplies
- **PHARMACOLOGIST**: Custom medications; reduced dependency risk

### CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR FIELD MEDICS

1. **Resource Management**: Track MSUs carefully - standard field kit only has 5 MSUs
2. **No Double-Dosing**: Second stimulant dose before crash = VERY BAD IDEA
3. **Crash Planning**: Plan for when the meds wear off (never during critical operations)
4. **Treatment Specificity**: Match treatment to specific injury when possible
5. **Complication Monitoring**: Watch for developing complications days after treatment
6. **Bedrest Is Best**: When possible, proper medical care > chemical solutions
