# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: MEDICAL SYSTEM

## CORE WOUND MECHANICS

### DURING COMBAT & IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH
- Characters can sustain up to 3 wounds with no mechanical penalties
- This represents adrenaline, training, and determination overcoming injury
- Reaching 4+ wounds = Incapacitation (character cannot act)

### POST-COMBAT & RECOVERY PHASE
- Wounds manifest penalties once the "adrenaline phase" ends (10-30 minutes after combat)
- Without medical intervention, each wound imposes a cumulative -20% penalty
- "You should be in bed, ya dope!" = Mechanical representation of pushing through injury

## INJURY SPECIFICATION SYSTEM

When a character receives a wound during gameplay:
1. Note the **cause of injury** (already known from gameplay)
2. Note the **location** (determined during combat or specified retroactively)
3. Roll percentile dice to determine **specific complications**

### WOUND LOCATION CHART

Location can be determined using the ones digit of the attack roll, or specified during narration:

## EXAMPLE MEDICAL SCENARIOS

### SCENARIO 1: ENERGY WEAPON INJURY

During a firefight with pirates, Rodriguez takes a ray gun blast to the arm (Energy Damage to Arms). The medic rolls 53 on the Energy Damage table: Movement Impairment.

**MEDICAL ASSESSMENT**
- The energy blast has disrupted nerve pathways in Rodriguez's arm
- Without treatment, he'll suffer -60% to all actions requiring that arm
- Team needs him functional for the remainder of the mission

**TREATMENT OPTIONS**

**OPTION A: BIOELECTRIC STABILIZER**
- Restores normal nerve function
- Rodriguez may experience occasional muscle twitches
- Uses 1 MSU

**OPTION B: STIM-SHOT**
- Negates all penalties for 6 hours
- Rodriguez will crash afterward with severe penalties
- Uses 1 MSU

**OPTION C: Z-RAY RECONSTRUCTION**
- Completely repairs the damage
- Adds 20% chance of mutation or energy sensitivity
- Requires Z-Ray equipment (available in ship's medical bay)

The team chooses Option A. During the mission, Rodriguez's arm suddenly locks up (Chronic Pain complication). He must make a GRIT×5 check to maintain control during a critical moment.

### SCENARIO 2: POST-MISSION COMPLICATIONS

**POST-MISSION FOLLOW-UP**
- Medical scan reveals Rodriguez has developed Medication Sensitivity
- He can never use Bioelectric Stabilizer again without severe reaction
- Team medic must now develop alternative treatment plans for future missions

**LONG-TERM CAMPAIGN IMPACT**
- Rodriguez now has a known medical vulnerability
- This creates interesting roleplaying opportunities
- May drive mission objectives (seeking specialized treatment)
- Creates a unique character trait that distinguishes him

### SCENARIO 3: MULTIPLE INJURY TREATMENT

The team has just finished a firefight with Mysterian agents. Rodriguez has taken 2 wounds, Takahashi has 3 wounds, and Chen is unharmed.

**DECISION POINT: IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH**
- They need to infiltrate a facility in 30 minutes when the adrenaline will wear off
- Medical Officer Chen must decide how to allocate limited medical resources

**OPTION A: STIM-SHOT FOR BOTH**
- Both operatives remain at full capacity for the infiltration
- Both will crash afterward, potentially during extraction
- Uses 2 Medical Supply Units

**OPTION B: STIM-SHOT FOR TAKAHASHI, TRAUMA PAK FOR RODRIGUEZ**
- Takahashi operates at full capacity but will crash later
- Rodriguez operates with only -20% penalty (instead of -40%)
- Uses 2 Medical Supply Units but creates staggered crash timeline

**OPTION C: PSYCHOTROPIC ANALGESIC FOR BOTH**
- Rodriguez chooses to take -40% to SAVVY (not needed for the mission)
- Takahashi takes -60% to SAVVY but maintains full REFLEX
- Uses 2 Medical Supply Units with no crash effect

The team chooses Option B. During the infiltration, Takahashi's Stim-Shot wears off earlier than expected. Chen faces another decision:
- Use last Stim-Shot (dangerous second dose)
- Abort mission and extract
- Continue with Takahashi suffering full penalties

## MEDICAL ADVENTURE HOOKS

1. **THE MYSTERIOUS PLAGUE**: Strange symptoms appear among colonists with no clear cause. Players must identify the source, develop treatment protocols, and prevent further spread.

2. **ALIEN PHYSIOLOGY EMERGENCY**: A non-human ally is critically injured with anatomy the team's medical officer has never encountered. Treatment must be improvised while racing against time.

3. **QUARANTINE CRISIS**: The team's ship is placed under quarantine after exposure to an unknown pathogen. They must identify the source, develop treatment, and convince authorities they are safe.

4. **MEDICAL SUPPLY HEIST**: Critical medication needed by a colony has been hijacked by pirates. The team must recover it before patients begin dying.

5. **MUTATION MANAGEMENT**: A team member develops beneficial mutations from Z-Ray exposure but struggles to control them. The team searches for a specialist who can help without eliminating the benefits.

6. **VINTAGE MEDICINE**: An abandoned pre-atomic research facility may contain forgotten medical technology that could revolutionize treatment of a new disease.

7. **MYSTERIANS EXPERIMENT**: Evidence suggests the Mysterians are testing bizarre medical procedures on human captives. The team must infiltrate their facility to discover the truth and rescue victims.

8. **THE ANCIENT CURE**: A planet's native population seems immune to a disease devastating human colonists. The team must earn the trust of xenophobic natives to learn their medical secrets.
