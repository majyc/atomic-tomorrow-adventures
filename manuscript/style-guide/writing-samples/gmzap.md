==============

Campaign design
---------------

Unless you are running a one-shot, you need to think a little bit
about the overall structure of the campaign you want to run. Many
things can be filled in as you go along, but some decisions have to
be made before you begin.

### Setting

SF can cover a mind-boggling array of settings. Here are some of the
common ones:

-   Near-future Earth

-   Alternate Earth

-   Far Past Earth

-   Post-Apocalyptic Earth

-   Far Future Earth

-   Virtual Reality

-   Solar System

-   Local Stellar Neighborhood

-   Star Cluster

-   Galaxy

-   Universe

-   Multiverse

#### Hard vs Soft SF

"Hard" SF is science fiction that
makes a conscious effort to make the science and technology in the
story stick to what we know, or at least surmise, and tries to be
modest in its extrapolations. The resulting "hardness"
of the SF falls on a continuum: the less extrapolation and the more
established the science, the "harder"...
the farther out and more speculative, the "softer",
until at the far end of the spectrum you get "science
fantasy", which is essentially magic in technological
drag. Allowance is often made for implausible science needed to make
the story work, such as faster-than-light travel or time travel, but
even there "harder" SF deliberately
tries to reduce the number of impossibilities and often to disguise
the ones it has by at least cloaking it in not-yet-absolutely-disproved
speculative science. Sometimes that the whole point of the story:
what would it be like if everything we knew for a fact was still the
same, but easy and cheap teleportation was possible?

To make the SF in Zap! "harder"
you want to rein in a bit on what's regarded as plausible according
to the Primary Rule. This has to be a joint effort by all the players
and the GM if you want to run a Hard SF setting. You want to aim for
verisimilitude, not strict scientific accuracy, but quickly fix any
spots that the any of the players notice strain that verisimilitude.
Strive to make the explanations of the abilities and gadgets consistent
with each other and over time, and obey the principle "There Ain't
No Such Thing As A Free Lunch" so there are drawbacks and limitations
to every power. Make liberal use of Disadvantages such as Shots, Erratic,
Limited, and Side Effects. Be particularly generous interpreting abilities
that are used to understand science and engineering when they are
applied to new phenomena and alien technology, to emphasize the universality
of science and the ability of intelligent creatures to understand
the basic principles of the universe.

##### Reversing the Polarity

What if you don't want the SF to feel harder, but instead
want to make your game wilder, wackier, and more like Science Fantasy?
Simple: you just reverse all the above advice. Try to break verisimilitude
by emphasizing things we know aren't true, like air
in space, space being filled with "ether",
perhaps even fire being caused by "phlogiston";
if players notice any inconsistency or contradiction, don't
correct it, elaborate on it and invent some esoteric explanation for
it (which may become a feature of the setting); make the rules that
govern the setting arbitrary and vary from place to place or character
to character; make the technology and science deliver free lunches
to all, with equipment that inexplicably has no apparent trade off
between power and weight and never needs maintenance, medicine that
has no side-effects, generators that create unlimited clean energy
cheaply, perpetual motion machines, new elements with mysterious properties
such as anti-gravity; make the science and technology unfamiliar,
even it it's just renaming things to seem exotic such
as calling radio waves "etheric vibrations"
or telescopes "panopticons".

#### [\[subsec:Standard-SF-templates\]]{#subsec:Standard-SF-templates label="subsec:Standard-SF-templates"}Standard SF templates

One way you can shape the setting for your game is to decide which
kind of SF creatures are common enough to warrant a template for player
characters. As mentioned earlier, usually the templates are geared
for playable creature types, those that can at least interact with
humans and have recognizable goals and concerns. However, even creatures
normally alien beyond comprehension, such as hyper-intelligent shades
of blue, can have that aspect deemphasized to allow them as player
characters.

Start with this bare bones template, filling in the power descriptions:

### The Campaign {#sec:TheCampaign .unnumbered}

### Episodic Or Epic? {#sec:EpisodicOrEpic}

Each session can be a self-contained adventure,
or the whole campaign can be a single mega-adventure, or something
in between.

In an episodic style of campaign, each adventure has a clear beginning,
middle and end. There may be ongoing plot threads and themes from
episode to episode, but the major focus of the episode comes to a
definite conclusion, with the PC's immediate goal (explore the planet,
establish contact with the alien race, escape from the cataclysm,
carry off the robbery) accomplished even if their ultimate motivation
for going on adventures hasn't been resolved. Emphasis on episodes
can mesh well with players' often hectic schedules, particularly if
the episodes are short, one or two sessions each, since a particular
character's absence from the current adventure doesn't tend to need
much explanation or leave a huge hole in the plot. This makes episodic
games ideal back-ups for when you don't have a quorum of your regular
players, for when you have a guest player or two, or just a "pick
up" game.

On the other hand, if players prefer an epic style campaign, where
there is a single over-arching plot or antagonist and everything builds
to a big climax dealing with that, it's certainly possible. One thing
to watch out for, besides the usual issues of players feeling "rail-roaded"
and unable to affect the plot except in minor details, is making sure
that the epic won't be short-circuited by the players defeating the
Big Bad or otherwise resolving the driving issue of the campaign prematurely.

Unless you're cheating, if it's possible for the players to defeat
the Big Bad or solve the problem without using a "Plot Device",
then it's possible that can happen any time they encounter him or
work on a solution, including the first time in what was intended
to be the prelude. If you want an epic campaign without cheating in
favor of whatever is driving the plot you should make sure that the
players can't come to grips with the main enemy or issue until the
climax, for instance by arranging that it can only be finally resolved
with a Plot Device, that the resolution require visiting various sites,
or that the plot can roll merrily along even without the main driver
to guide it.

Examples:

-   The villain can reconstitute himself given time unless the virus has
    been uploaded into the Master System.

-   The expanding singularity that will engulf the galaxy can only be
    halted by detonating a device from within it, which the heroes have
    to embark on an epic quest to deliver.

-   Driving back the invaders will require diplomatic missions to all
    of the rival factions to get them on board, and they may have demands
    in return for cooperation that will in turn lead to adventures.

-   The enemy has set something in motion that his capture won't stop
    ("You may have defeated me, but the Sun Eater shall continue on
    a straight path through the inhabited galaxy regardless! Bwa ha ha
    ha!").

-   There is a lieutenant or secondary bad guy waiting in the wings to
    step in when the original instigator is dealt with.

-   The clever plan by which the heroes halted the initial problem has
    generated side-effects that need to be dealt with before the campaign
    is truly over.

Or, you could just deal with the anticlimax, allow the players to
have their triumph, and move on to the next arc. Many, perhaps even
most, players would prefer to have an unexpectedly short and successful
"epic" than be railroaded to a predetermined conclusion; just
because they'd love to blow up the Death Star doesn't necessarily
mean that they'll love it if you arbitrarily thwart their every attempt
to prevent its construction along the way in order to get to that
final scene.

It is also possible to combine the episodic and epic: have an epic
campaign in the big picture, leavened with one or two-session adventures
that relate tangentially or not at all to the over-arching plot. This
is the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" model of story arcs: over the
course of a "season" of twelve or even more sessions there is
a major enemy working towards a final Earth-shattering scheme, but
aside from a bit of foreshadowing in each episode the big scheme proceeds
in fits and starts while most of the adventures deal with largely
unrelated schemes by different bad guys. In fiction, the heroes may
be completely unaware of the presence of the chief bad guy of the
arc until it's time for the climax, with only the audience seeing
how step-by-step he gets closer to his goal; in an RPG that doesn't
work as well, unless the players are unusually open to having "cut
scenes" of out-of-character knowledge just for flavor. A better
model is for the heroes to be slowly acquiring the clues needed to
figure out the plot or pieces of the Plot Device to defeat the main
threat.

Designing an Adventure
----------------------

### What you need to design

An adventure is a problem that confronts the PCs. The problem might
be specific, concrete, and demand that something be done immediately
(there is an alien loose on the ship, and if it's not captured or
killed it will eat everybody's heads), or it might be vague and long-range
(the PCs need more information about what the factions are in Gamma
Quadrant before they can make any decision about alliances), but if
the PCs have no problems to solve, there's nothing to game and you
might as well advance the action until there *is* a problem that
needs their attention. It is usually better not to plan out a detailed
sequence of scenes to be played out in linear fashion, but instead
to invent a set of elements (aliens, people to talk to, clues, events,
special objects, secrets) that might be inserted when needed. The
rest of the section are guidelines with suggestions about which elements
to design. Feel free to use or ignore these as you feel fit.

### Adventure Arcs

Adventures are usually problems that need to be solved. Most adventures
will go through three stages: Exposition, Investigation, and Confrontation.
In the Exposition stage the PC's learn of a problem, and hopefully
decide to do something with that information, even if they don't know
exactly what yet. This is when the basic premise of the adventure
is laid out. In a television episode, this is typically the stuff
that happens before the opening credits, where we learn our intrepid
crew is on their way to Canopis IV carrying medical supplies to stop
an outbreak of the Denebian Plague. In a campaign that is designed
more around the PC's goals rather than a series of specific adventures,
the exposition stage might consist of nothing more than a brief list
of things the PC's activities have turned up that sound like they
might be of use towards those goals, or problems that have cropped
up that might interfere with them, allowing the players to decide
which they want to pursue first or if they care at all. "Production
is down at your robotic mining facility in Delta Sector, but the foreman
can't explain why; meanwhile the ambassador from the Outer Planets
is meeting with your arch-rival, the head of the Argus Conglomerate,
and the chief scientist of your wormhole project has reported they
are ready for a small-scale test."

Once the PC's have a goal, either invented, handed to them, or forced
on them by circumstances the Investigation stage begins. In this stage
they use their skills and resources to try to learn more about the
parameters of the problem or resources that might help them reach
their goal. In SF, investigation will often involve Research, either
as part of the scenes needed for a Scientist building a gadget to
address the problem, or to advance the PC's other goals.

Finally, there is the Confrontation stage, where it all comes together
and their immediate plans are resolved one way or the other. This
doesn't necessarily mean they reach their ultimate goal: in some campaigns
it may be impossible to reach that goal by design such as when the
campaign is about the five-year mission to explore strange new worlds,
or a rag-tag fleet of ships fleeing disaster and seeking the lost
home of humanity. Nevertheless, the intermediate goals, whether they
are episodes or campaign arcs, need to get resolved so the players
have some sense of forward momentum. Things might not always work
out as the PC's wanted. Depending on how things play out they might
be resolved with a set-back or disaster, a partial victory that leads
to further goals and adventures, or even a complete triumph for the
good guys. Part of the point of Zap! is let the players and GM be
surprised by exactly how things turn out. If the GM knows in advance
both what the climactic scene is going to look like and how it turns
out, it's too tightly plotted; it's important to leave plenty of freedom
for the players actions to matter to the outcome.

### Interleaving arcs

This sequence of exposition, investigation, and confrontation, which
we'll call an arc, can be a single session or multiple sessions. Not
every event needs to be related to the current arc. In addition, you
can have multiple arcs in play in a single session. One way to do
this is to weave the arcs together, with some of the exposition of
the next arc happening during the investigation of the previous arc.
You can also link some or all of the arcs together into a "seasonal
arc", with a whole adventure serving the same purpose of one scene
in the master arc for the season. For example, suppose the master
arc is about an expedition of unscrupulous explorers planning to excavate
a Precusor site. The first adventure could be the PC's crossing paths
with the explorers who are attempting to steal data from a PC or ally
of the PC's that they need to located the site. Thus, the whole adventure
serves as the exposition segment of the master arc, with the purpose
that the PC's learn of the explorers and their theft of data, but
not the purpose of the intended theft.

![image](Battle01.png){width="1\\columnwidth"}

### Failure is always an option. Success is always an option

Whenever you plan for an encounter, never assume that the players
will succeed or that they will fail. For example, don't plan an adventure
with the assumption that the explorers will steal the data from the
players, because they might succeed at stopping the theft. On the
other hand, don't make the adventure contingent on the players capturing
a thief, because they may not succeed at capturing her, or they may
decide to kill her, or make a deal with her. Better is to say, "The
explorers will attempt to steal the data from the players" and make
a plan for further encounters whether or not the theft succeeds. If
you really need the data stolen, it is better to have it be stolen
before the adventure even begins. It is unfair, but at least you're
not trying to fool your players into thinking it was their fault.

### The End of The World is not the end of the world

Allowing for the possibility of failure does not mean the stakes cannot
be high. What is a complete disaster from the player character's point
of view can be an invigorating change of pace for the campaign. In
a science fiction game even death is often reversible, either literally
or with the possibility of returning as a clone, VR personality, or
alternate universe version. If the explorers succeed at opening the
Precursor site and reactivating the Cyborgmen, the next few arcs can
be the players gathering information and completing a weapon capable
of deactivating the Cyborgmen, pursued by them and their ever-growing
army of creatures they've cyborged. Even if the whole world is converted
to Cyborgmen colony, this opens up new drama as the players become
part of a resistance movement, fighting the new order. Failure should
have consequences, but the aftermath of failure should be a new adventure,
not just instant obliteration.

Plot Templates
--------------

While there's a variety of creatures, local color, and fantastic features
in science fiction, many of the basic plots are in standardized patterns.
The following sample plots are meant to provide some structure that
you can incorporate your creative ideas onto, not as a substitute
for your creativity.

Each standard plot outlines some possibilities for Introduction scenes,
sub-goals that both the players and enemies will pursue in Investigation,
and how final Confrontations might play out depending on whether the
player or their foes seem to have the upper hand during the investigation
phase, some Twists that can be added to the standard plots to make
them less predictable or more meaningful to the players and the Aftermath,
suggesting what happens after the Confrontation, especially if the
player characters lose.

### Altered Reality {#altered-reality .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The status quo has been dramatically changed.
    Maybe a time traveler has stopped Julius Caesar's assassination, and
    the Roman Empire continues to the current day.

Special:

:   An altered reality arc can be a mini-campaign within
    the campaign. It is best to have some time to think and prepare before
    starting. If a world-changing event happens unexpectedly in a session,
    it is good to end the session then and let both players and GM think
    through the consequences. The campaign and PCs may require a total
    redesign. New standard creature templates may be called for, either
    to replace existing ones (e.g., robots may have a very different template
    in a world without technology) or to reflect new possibilities (e..g,
    every normal human may have gained a distinct superpower). The scope
    of the campaign may change in the new reality, usually increasing.
    For example, the PCs may become godlike beings, or have one-time access
    to a powerful creature. One possibility is to issue new guidelines
    and allow total redesign of player characters for the arc. Players
    may choose to play a new character or almost unrecognizable version
    of their existing character. Existing villains may become the PCs
    and the existing PCs villains or NPCs, e.g., the altered history on
    Buffy where Willow had become a vampire and turned many of the Scooby
    gang. In any case, give XP to the player, not the character.

Introductory scenes:

:   Skip ahead beyond the change. Start with
    "slice of life" scenes under the new regime. How are the PCs adapting,
    how are they altered? The PCs then meet and get reacquainted (or
    perhaps meet for the first time.) Finally, they start getting clues
    that it might be possible to reverse the change. (This may require
    them to realize there's been a change.)

Sub-goals and confrontation scenes:

:   Once the PCs decide to
    reverse the change (if they do), the rest of the arc consists of the
    PCs first figuring out what is necessary to reverse the change, which
    may involve investigating what caused it in the first place. The PCs
    may need to compile the equipment for a device or experiment to revert
    to the original status quo, while the enemy is trying to stop them.
    The confrontation scene happens just before or after they complete
    the set-up.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players have figured out
    what they need to do to restore reality and have completed the necessary
    preparations; all that remains is to go through the process, and their
    foes have a limited window of opportunity to stop them.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The players are still missing
    a crucial component or piece of information needed to ensure success,
    but they're out of time and the foes are in a position to attempt
    to stop them for good. The PCs may have to go ahead with the flawed
    uncertain process or risk being unable to ever restore reality, or
    perhaps will only be able to do so at greatly increased cost to themselves.

Twists:

:   The *status quo* the players are familiar with is
    actually the result of a previous reality alteration. What if Rome
    only fell in the first place because of intervention by a time traveler?
    Ought the PCs oppose or aid in attempts to restore the prior reality?
    How much do they know about what it was like before, and what duty
    do they owe the people in the current reality who might find themselves
    worse off or cease to exist if the time-line is restored?

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, the change is reversed. The world
    returns to the *status quo ante*. Perhaps it is retroactive;
    the change never happened as far as most are concerned. Or perhaps
    the memory of the change leads to permanent changes in the status
    quo, shifting of alliances, or creation of laws and enforcement organizations
    to prevent such changes in the future (e.g. Time Police). If the
    PCs fail, they or other characters can try again, with a different
    approach.

![image](warrior_princess_of_mars_by_jamused-d3ji73s.png){width="7.5in"}

### Back in Time {#back-in-time .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs travel back in time, voluntarily or not,
    and have to find a way to return to their own time. If voluntary,
    they may have a mission to perform first.

Introductory scenes:

:   The PCs uncover the means to travel back
    in time, a reason to do so, or are just thrust willy-nilly back by
    some phenomenon, alien artifact, or device gone awry.

PC sub-goals:

:   Uncover the means to return to their own time;
    accomplish their mission if they must do that first; reverse whatever
    disruption to the time-line they may have caused upon arrival.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If this was a plot by enemies, prevent the
    PCs from accomplishing their mission or returning; otherwise they
    may encounter new enemies in the past who are trying to capture or
    stop them for reasons of their own, perhaps not even knowing they
    are time travelers.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have accomplished their
    mission or gathered the information/built the equipment necessary
    to return. Now they need the right conditions or the right time to
    activate it.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have failed in their
    primary mission, but to stay to accomplish it is to risk being trapped
    or having the secret of time travel fall into the wrong hands.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, they are back when they came from
    and the time line is as intended (including any changes they went
    back to accomplish); if they failed then either they're back but the
    time-line is not as they wished, or even worse than when they set
    out, or they remain trapped in the past.

Twists:

:   The PCs travel forward in time; there they may find out
    information about the future that makes it imperative they return
    to their original time and prevent that future from happening, or
    they may decide they like it better and not return. Relativistic time
    dilation and cryogenics are also common one-way tickets to the future
    in SF.

### Creature Feature {#creature-feature .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   A creature is rampaging. While the creature could
    be a mindless hulk or a super-intelligent alien, it has a overwhelming
    need that drives it to repetitive violence. The creature will strike
    again and again until it is stopped, presumably by the PCs.

Introductory scenes:

:   Viewing carnage from the creature's rampage;
    hearing about same on the news; helping a victim escape; being called
    in as experts by authorities.

PC sub-goals:

:   Identify creature. Interview experts on creatures
    of that type. Discover their weaknesses and drives. Rescue hostages
    and potential victims. Recruit allies equipped to handle these creatures.
    Track creature to lair.

Enemy[ sub-goals]{.smallcaps}:

:   Rampage. As the creature escalates the
    violence, it forces the PCs to confront it before they are ready,
    or be responsible for its destruction continuing. Capture hostages.
    Feed and grow stronger.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players know about this
    creature, what urges cause it to rampage, what it wants, and what
    its vulnerabilities are. They free the hostages, then use their knowledge
    to lure the creature into a trap.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   At its strongest, the creature
    strikes in a way the PCs cannot ignore, perhaps threatening their
    families, friends, or homes. The PCs fight the creature, but are distracted
    by the need to help the innocent victims being threatened.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs win, the creature is usually destroyed
    or neutralized, and the next session will start a new, unrelated arc.
    If the PCs lose, the creature may get stronger and attack again, so
    the next session would be a continuation, perhaps with more twists,
    as potential allies are recruited to help and enemies try to take
    advantage of the chaos caused by the creature.

Twists:

:   Scooby-doo: "Creature" is a ruse, to cover a more
    mundane scheme. Creature is sympathetic, e.g, the Hulk. Creature has
    a sympathetic alter ego, e.g., the Lizard from Spider-man. Creature
    targets unsympathetic victims, e.g., is driven by justified vengeance.
    Creature targets PCs, or those connected to PCs. Creature gains strength
    from successful feedings. Creature is sophisticated, and lures victims
    with psychological traps rather than brute strength. Creature hypnotizes
    or transmutes victims into monstrous accomplices.

### First Contact {#first-contact .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   Initial contact with an alien, or an entire alien
    culture. This could be the first such contact ever, or part of the
    PC's job as xeno-contact specialists; if the the latter, there should
    be some complication or difficulty that makes it an adventure rather
    than a day at the office.

Special:

:   First contact can for the basis for an entire campaign,
    either as one overarching set of adventures dealing with coming into
    contact with the aliens, figuring out how to communicate with them,
    overcoming misunderstandings or physical difficulties in sharing space,
    finding common ground and establishing ongoing relations. In this
    kind of campaign, the GM should probably work out a lot of details
    about the aliens and their goals in advance, even though none of this
    information will be apparent to the PCs for a long time, if ever.
    Alternatively, a first contact campaign can deal with a new contact
    each week, allowing the players to continue to meet new and different
    alien cultures and solve a variety of problems as they seek out new
    life and new civilizations, in which case the GM merely has to make
    up enough for the next episode.

Introductory scenes:

:   Receiving an alien signal, getting called
    in to investigate mysterious phenomena which turn out to be caused
    by aliens, finding evidence of ancient aliens that gives a clue into
    establishing or re-establishing contact.

PC sub-goals:

:   Discover more about the aliens, determine whether
    they are hostile, establish relations, prevent the PC's enemies from
    taking advantage of the aliens.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   if the aliens are hostile discover more about
    the PCs and their weaknesses, if the aliens are friendly the PC's
    enemies might be trying to exploit them or recruit them as allies
    against the PCs.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players know what the aliens
    are and how to communicate with them, or what their weaknesses are
    if they're hostile.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   Hostile aliens know about the
    PCs and what their weaknesses are; friendly aliens have been duped
    into regarding the PCs as hostile.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs win hostile aliens have been destroyed,
    neutralized or made friends with, or the PC's enemies' machinations
    have been exposed for what they are. If the PCs lose the aliens have
    gained the upper hand, and perhaps invaded; the PC's enemies have
    made an alliance with the aliens and the PCs will have to face them
    as a combined force in the future.

Twists:

:   The PCs are the aliens, isolated from their own culture
    and allies. The aliens are actually a hoax. Apparently friendly aliens
    are actually hostile, or vice-versa.

### Great Race {#great-race .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The characters become involved in a race, often
    against multiple other competitors. Sometimes this is purely a sporting
    proposition, at other times there is something larger at stake, possibly
    up to and including the fate of the universe.

Special:

:   A great race scenario can be a good way to visit a lot
    of different locales in the setting, without spending a lot of time
    in each, so the GM should probably have enough interesting places
    and incidents work out in advance so that the PCs can visit more than
    one a session without having to stop or wing it.

Introductory scenes:

:   A race is announced, with a prize sufficient
    to tempt the PCs, or they come across some information that means
    they need to outrun a bunch of competitors.

PC sub-goals:

:   Gain an advantage in the race by discovering information
    leading to shortcuts, improving their vehicle, avoiding obstacles
    and hostile forces. Unscrupulous PCs may try to sabotage the competitors
    or throw obstacles in their way.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Same as the PCs.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players are in a superior
    position as it comes to the end of the race and need to hold on to
    their lead.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The enemies are in a superior
    position and the players must come up with some way to overtake them.

Aftermath:

:   The players can enjoy their prize and notoriety, if
    it was a sporting event, and it can be a stepping-stone to further
    such events. If the "race" was for higher stakes, such as recovery
    and mastery of some unique alien technology, further adventures can
    revolve around the PCs using that technology and others trying to
    wrest it from them. If the PCs lose, they can plot their come-back,
    if it was a sporting event, or deal with the repercussions of their
    enemies having whatever it is they were racing for.

Twists:

:   What appears to be a sporting event turns out to have
    a deeper significance, which only begins to be revealed to the PCs
    when their opponents are going to greater lengths to win than the
    prize would warrant. The race is to stay ahead of some cataclysmic
    event or invading alien horde.

### Marooned {#marooned .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs are stranded somewhere, cut off from
    civilization and without their normal means of transportation. They
    need to somehow get new means of transportation, get to somewhere
    where they can re-establish contact, or even in extreme scenarios
    find some way to settle in and build an new life in the new locale.
    Marooned can form the basis of an entire campaign if the PCs are marooned
    on a backwater planet or hiding from powerful enemies, or in a new
    dimension or time. E.T., Lost, Sliders and Quantum Leap all follow
    this format.

Special:

:   because the PCs may spend a lot of time in the new location,
    it probably needs more detail than a typical planet-side stop. In
    addition, the GM should probably consider and perhaps consult with
    the players whether they're actually interested in the scenario; if
    the players' chief enjoyment is hopping from place to place encountering
    new settings every session, wrecking their ship and sticking them
    on a primitive backwater may feel like a punishment instead of an
    adventure. The GM should be prepared to wrap things up quickly, and
    get the PCs back to doing what they're interested in.

Introductory scenes:

:   A disaster strikes, and the PCs are forced
    into the new locale and possibly stripped of the vehicle and much
    of the standard gear.

PC sub-goals:

:   Discover information about where they are and
    what resources they have to escape or restore contact. Survive, establish
    relationships with locals who might be able to help.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   There may not be actual enemies; if there are
    and they're responsible for the PCs being marooned, they may be trying
    to find the PCs to finish the job. The PCs might also make enemies
    among the locals.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have survived, figured
    out where they are and how to get away, and have a shot at doing so.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   If there are enemies responsible
    for the PCs predicament, they have located the PCs and are poised
    to deliver a set-back, such as capturing them or ruining their current
    rescue plan.

Aftermath:

:   The PCs succeed in getting rescued or back to their
    usual haunts; if there were enemies responsible, they can decide to
    take action against them, otherwise they might just return to their
    normal adventures. If they lost their ship, they might have to work
    to get a new one. If the enemies succeeded the PCs may need to escape
    from captivity or come up with another plan, or resign themselves
    to their new home.

Twists:

:   The location where the PCs are Marooned is not what they
    thought it was (e.g. actually a resort area, and they were close to
    rescue all along, or they are unwitting contestants in a game of some
    sort).

### Mayday {#mayday .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs receive a distress signal, and have to
    deal with it.

Introductory scenes:

:   They receive the distress signal, and decide
    what to do about it.

PC sub-goals:

:   Gain information about the sender and the situation,
    establish contact with any survivors, rescue the survivors, avoid
    whatever it was that caused the situation in the first place.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If there's an actual enemy, complete the piracy,
    kidnap, robbery or invasion that prompted the distress signal, get
    information about the PCs, their plans and resources.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The players have enough information
    that they can attempt the rescue or to defeat the enemy.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The enemy are about to finish
    their work and get away, e.g. they've located the executive they sabotaged
    the ship so they could board and kidnap. They have identified the
    PCs and where they are well enough to plan an ambush.

Aftermath:

:   If successful, the PCs could have the gratitude of
    those they've rescued, leading to offers of work; they might have
    salvaged some valuable gear or even an adventure-triggering MacGuffin.
    If not, the PCs may need to repair their ship and recover from losses,
    or to track down and pursue the enemies who have accomplished their
    objective.

Special:

:   A MacGuffin that either caused or was the target of
    whatever caused the distress signal can be a springboard for further
    adventures.

Twists:

:   It's a trap, or the distress signal is extremely old,
    and when the PCs arrive the situation is not what they expected. This
    could be everybody is dead but there's some horrible monster (Alien),
    but it could also be the descendants of the survivors have settled
    the locale and aren't in direct need of rescue\...or they are, but
    it's logistically difficult because of their numbers or the fact that
    they've regressed to savagery and don't understand what's at stake
    (e.g. their colony ship is heading for the sun).

### Mirror World {#mirror-world .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs are projected into an alternate universe
    where things are backwards; usually the morality of the organizations
    and people are reversed, though there may be additional reversals
    such as the sex or personalities of some or all of the characters
    (e.g. a cold, logical being might have a hot-tempered and excitable
    "mirror twin").

Introductory scenes:

:   The accident or experiment where the PCs
    enter the mirror world; first meeting the mirror world counterparts
    and figuring out that's what they are.

PC sub-goals:

:   Learn enough to be able to pass for mirror world
    inhabitants while they figure out how to get home; figure out how
    to get home.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Learn that the PCs aren't the people they're
    pretending to be, learn where they came from and how, figure out how
    to exploit that.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs learn enough to return
    to their own world, and accomplish their goals if any in the mirror
    world.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs are exposed and the enemies
    are prepared to capture them or exploit the fact they're not their
    counterparts, or the enemies are ready to enter the PCs world.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs succeed, they get back home. One or more
    of the PCs may be accompanied or replaced by a mirror world double.
    If the PCs failed, they are either stuck in the mirror world and need
    to try again or make do, or they may be back in their own world but
    have to hunt down and deal with mirror world enemies who've also come
    over; these may be duplicates of the PCs, or their allies, or important
    NPCs in the PCs' world.

Twists:

:   It's the mirror universe twins who come visiting the
    PC's universe.

### Negative Space Wedgie {#negative-space-wedgie .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   The PCs encounter a strange anomaly (in the parlance
    of TV Tropes, a "Negative Space Wedgie", from a scene in the parody
    *Star Drek*) that creates a crisis they must deal with. Often
    the anomaly does something completely bizarre and magical, even in
    settings which otherwise adhere to relatively plausible science. PCs
    might encounter future selves, age incredibly quickly, or be de-aged,
    be transported to a far quadrant of the galaxy, etc.

Introductory scenes:

:   The PCs detect the anomaly; they may decide
    to investigate, or be suddenly subjected to it.

PC sub-goals:

:   Determine the exact nature of the anomaly, or
    at least how to avoid or reverse its effects. Discover a way to use
    the anomaly to address some other problem they have been having. Simply
    deal with or survive the more extreme effects.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   Anomalies don't usually involve overt enemies.
    If they do, they are the backdrop against which the enemy is confronted:
    e.g. the PCs and an enemy warship both get sucked into an anomaly
    and shot across the galaxy: in order to return to their own sector
    they must come to an accommodation of some sort.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs learn enough to ameliorate
    or reverse the anomaly and safely escape. Otherwise escape might occur
    without them being able to reverse the effects.

Aftermath:

:   If the PCs are successful there usually aren't any
    long term consequences, though if the anomaly is stable and they understand
    it, they might find a use for it in the future; if they weren't successful
    in dealing with the anomaly they might have to live with or seek a
    cure for whatever effects the anomaly visited upon them.

Special:

:   Negative Space Wedgies might kick off a campaign, for
    instance leading to a marooned scenario, or granting the PCs strange
    powers that sets up the campaign.

Twists:

:   Almost anything goes.

### War Zone {#war-zone .unnumbered}

Basic premise:

:   Open hostilities have broken out between two
    or more factions in the setting. The PCs are caught in the middle.
    They may be recruited as allies by one or more sides, or just seek
    to minimize the collateral damage.

Introductory scenes:

:   PCs hear word of tension between the factions.
    The PCs encounter a battlefield, either during or after the fight.
    The sides either court the PCs or warn them against siding against
    them.

PC sub-goals:

:   The PCs may decide to root for one side to win,
    they may decide to try to end the conflict, or they might just try
    to keep it out of the way of innocents. In any case, the PCs will
    investigate the causes of the conflict, try to determine what each
    side wants and what they will settle for, and try to talk neutral
    factions into co-operating with the PCs goals.

Enemy sub-goals:

:   If the PCs take sides, the other faction will
    try to neutralize or eliminate them. If they stay neutral, the two
    sides may try to recruit them or scare them away. Both sides will
    try to weaken their adversaries, gain special weapons, and recruit
    powerful allies.

Player-advantage confrontation:

:   Having assembled an alliance
    against the aggressor, the PCs lure them into a battle in a remote
    location. Alternatively, the PCs manage to address both sides concerns
    and stop the final battle before it begins.

Enemy-advantage confrontation:

:   The PCs have joined the losing
    side. A vast alliance is assembled against them and their weakened
    faction. They make a desperate last stand, outnumbered. Or their attempts
    to bring peace have back-fired, and the two factions unite against
    the PCs.

Aftermath:

:   The losing faction may be weakened or eliminated.
    The winners may be strengthened or they may also be weakened. Third
    party factions may try to take advantage of a power vacuum.

Twists:

:   PCs have mixed loyalties, with some rooting for one side
    and others the other. A third party is responsible for stirring up
    tension between the warring factions, and will use the war as a distraction
    covering its own plans.
