# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## CHARACTER CREATION

*The Solar System of the atomic future needs heroes with grit, charm, and rocket-powered determination. This system guides you through creating a character ready for adventure among the planets.*

## FOUR-COLUMN CHARACTER CREATION

Characters in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures are created by selecting one option from each of four columns, building a complete concept that combines extraordinary qualities, professional expertise, cultural origin, and personal background.

### THE FOUR COLUMNS

| Column A                         | Column B             | Column C              | Column D                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **EPITHET**                | **PROFESSION** | **ORIGIN**      | **BACKGROUND**        |
| *What makes you extraordinary* | *What you do*      | *Where you're from* | *Your upbringing or past* |

By combining these four elements, you'll create a distinctive character with a clear concept, like "Two-Fisted Rocket Jockey from  Martian Military Family" or "Brilliant Scientist from Venus with Academic Training."

## GENERATING ATTRIBUTES

Your seven core attributes form the foundation of your character's capabilities.

### ATTRIBUTE GENERATION BY ORIGIN

- **TERRANS**: Must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 (distributed as desired)
- **ALL OTHER ORIGINS**: Roll 2d10 for each attribute and arrange, with results below 3 becoming 3 and results above 18 becoming 18
- **TERRAN EXILES**: May roll attributes like other origins instead of using the Standard Array

The only way to have attributes outside the 3-18 range is through Origin or Background modifiers, which are applied after the initial generation.

### ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, reaction speed
- **NERVE**: Mental composure, courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, craftiness

## COLUMN A: EPITHET

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. It provides special abilities and unique dice roll interpretations that other characters don't possess.

*Choose one background that best represents your character's upbringing.*

## CALCULATING SKILLS

Your skill percentages are determined by combining your Core (attribute contribution or FLEXX) with bonuses from Profession, Origin, and Background:

### Skill Formula

**Core** = either Attribute × 2 or 20% for FLEX skills, +5%

**Final Skill %** = Core + Professional Bonus + Origin Bonus + Background Bonus

### Skill Level Guide

- **0-25%**: Novice (basic understanding)
- **26-50%**: Competent (reliable in most situations)
- **51-75%**: Professional (expert in the field)
- **76-95%**: Master (among the best in the Solar System)
- **96%+**: Legendary (stuff of future stories)

## FINISHING TOUCHES

### Solar Scouts Training

Every character starts with Solar Scouts Training, which represents self-defense training (or school of hard knocks) that they've been given in their upbringing

- Solar Scouts Training is Reflex x 2 + 15%.  It never goes up, but you should track critical success checks normally
- Solar Scouts Training covers unarmed combat, pistols, rifles, survival, and first aid
- When making advancement checks if you have a Solar Scouts Training check to make, success will grant you the appropriate specialization, e.g. Combat (Pistols) and you'll stop using Solar Scouts Training for that skill, while still using it for other combat modes.
