## CREATING SHIP PERSONALITY

To use these tables to create a distinctive ship with narrative flavor:

1. **Select an Aesthetic Profile** that establishes the ship's visual identity
2. **Roll 2-4 times on the Ship's Quirks Table** (suggestion: roll once more than the number of players)
3. **Connect the results** into a coherent narrative that explains how these quirks relate

The goal is to create ships with personality and history that provide narrative hooks without mechanical advantages or disadvantages.

## EXAMPLES

**The Nova Duchess (Luxury Liner Aesthetic)**
*Rolls: 09 (Space Race Victor), 35 (Dream Patterns), 82 (Welded Tribute)*

This elegant vessel's gleaming hull still bears the distinctive gold racing stripes from when it won the Terra-Venus Regatta decades ago. In the observation lounge, a small brass plaque has been welded to the wall—a tribute to Captain Eleanor Swift who piloted the ship to victory but was lost in a later racing accident. Most curiously, crew members who sleep aboard during Venusian orbit report similar dreams of spectacular aerial races through golden clouds. The ship's previous owners considered this a sign that Captain Swift's spirit still watches over the vessel.

**The Rust Bucket (Belt Patchwork Aesthetic)**
*Rolls: 12 (Mysterious Discovery), 26 (Peculiar Vibration), 63 (Experimental Material), 98 (Mechanical Oddity)*

Found adrift near the Trojan asteroids with no crew and no records, this vessel's origins remain a complete mystery. Its patchwork hull incorporates an unidentified bluish alloy in the forward sections that occasionally vibrates at a frequency that induces a slight sense of calm in those nearby. Most puzzling is the custom-built device in what should be the navigation room—a mechanical apparatus with constantly moving parts that doesn't appear to connect to any ship system yet continues to function perfectly despite numerous attempts to determine its purpose.

**The Red Seeker (Scientific Explorer Aesthetic)**
*Rolls: 04 (Research Platform), 33 (Weather Predictor), 59 (Mysterian Story)*

This research vessel served as a long-term orbital laboratory during the controversial Martian atmosphere experiments of the '80s. The ship's computer systems exhibit an uncanny ability to predict solar flares and ion storms hours before official monitoring stations detect them—a feature that emerged after the vessel's alleged encounter with a Mysterian craft near Deimos. While the official record states it was merely a sensor malfunction, the ship's original science team installed several unusual detection instruments afterward that remain operational despite no one understanding exactly what they measure.
