# The Initial Attack

The Mysterion attack on The Aphrodite's Pearl liner wasn't random - they were specifically targeting the ship to capture it intact (before the crew's resistance forced more drastic measures). This uncharacteristic inner-system attack has raised alarms throughout the Solar System.

## Emergency Routes

From the aft recreation area to escape:

1. Primary route: Turbolifts to Deck 8 (will be disabled during the attack)
2. Secondary route: Emergency ladders in maintenance shafts (requiring manual override)
3. Service corridors leading to central spine of the ship
4. Maintenance tunnels through the water reclamation system

This layout creates a perfect scenario where:

* The sudden loss of thrust causes the pool cover to trap swimmers
* The telekinetic can potentially help free them
* The mercenary will need to navigate to Deck 1 or 2 to reach the cargo holds
* The roboticist has butler robots to reprogram
* The pilot will need to reach Deck 8 and determine which lifeboat is operational
* Mysterions would logically enter from upper decks, working their way down

The journey from Deck 6 to Deck 8 with ship systems compromised creates the perfect gauntlet for your adventure's opening!

## Option 1: Head Downward First

**Advantages:**

* The mercenary can retrieve weapons from personal cargo
* The roboticist might find useful tech components
* They could potentially gather survival supplies for Venus

**Risks:**

* Longer overall journey
* Mysterions might secure all lifeboats before they can reach them
* More opportunities to encounter patrols

## Option 2: Head Upward Immediately

**Advantages:**

* Secure escape before all lifeboats are gone
* Faster evacuation from the failing ship
* Less chance of encountering Mysterions (who are likely working top-down)

**Risks:**

* Minimal equipment for surviving on Venus
* No weapons for defense
* Fewer resources if the lifeboat is damaged during escape

## Option 3: Hide and Wait It Out

**Advantages:**

* Avoid direct confrontation with Mysterions entirely
* The water tanks on Deck 3 provide an excellent hiding place:
  * Shielded from most sensors
  * Access to water and basic life support
  * Connected to the storm shelter with its emergency supplies
* Could potentially rescue other passengers once Mysterions depart

**Risks:**

* Uncertainty about Mysterion plans (will they take the ship? destroy it?)
* Limited information about what's happening elsewhere on the vessel
* Possible detection if hiding place isn't secure
* No guarantee the Mysterions will actually leave

The telekinetic might sense Mysterion movement throughout the ship, creating a stealth scenario where they must stay quiet and hidden as alien search parties move nearby.

If they choose this option, the GM could create tension by having:

* The sound of Mysterions systematically searching decks
* Brief glimpses through vents of paralyzed humans being collected
* Ship systems occasionally malfunctioning, threatening to reveal their position
* A wounded crew member they rescue who provides partial information about the attack

## The Missing Mysterions

When your players investigate (either through their own initiative or official channels), they discover a crucial anomaly:

* Highport's observatory tracked the attacking vessels entering Venus's atmosphere rather than departing the system
* SID 2000 reports no Mysterion craft leaving Venus's vicinity after the attack
* This breaks the established pattern of Mysterion "hit-and-run" tactics observed for decades

## Investigation Threads

### Highport Observatory

From the observatory's tracking data, players could determine:

* The Mysterion craft descended to specific coordinates in Venus's equatorial oceans
* The craft appeared to utilize a unique orbital approach that minimized visibility
* Previous similar descent patterns were misclassified as instrument errors

### Victoria Colonial Records

In Victoria's archives, they might discover:

* A classified 1997 report detailing the recovery of an unusual submersible craft with breathing liquid technology
* The expedition team that investigated disappeared shortly after filing their initial findings
* The recovered technology influenced early Endural development before the connection was classified

### Port Charles Rumors

From dockworkers and fringe elements in Port Charles:

* Stories of "ghost ships" that emerge from the ocean during severe storms
* Salvagers who disappeared while investigating certain deep-water wrecks
* Unusual equipment sometimes recovered from the depths that's quickly confiscated by authorities

### Nimbus City Scientific Anomalies

Researchers in Nimbus City have noted:

* Inexplicable atmospheric composition changes originating from the oceans
* Periodic electromagnetic disturbances that align with Mysterion activity patterns
* Weather pattern manipulations that create "blind spots" over certain ocean regions

## Revelation Path

As players follow these threads, they could ultimately:

1. **Acquire Coordinates** - Pinpoint the approximate location of underwater Mysterion activity
2. **Discover Entryways** - Learn of natural formations or abandoned research facilities that provide access
3. **Obtain Technology** - Find or develop technology that allows them to survive in the hyper-oxygenated liquid environment
4. **Infiltrate Deep Haven** - Enter the hidden Mysterion base, perhaps initially mistaken for captives
5. **Uncover the Truth** - Learn that Venus has been a long-term Mysterion staging area, not just a recent target

## The Bigger Mystery

The ultimate revelation could be that the Mysterions aren't just using Venus as a convenient hiding place - they're specifically interested in:

* The Forerunner technology unique to Venus's underwater ruins
* Biological adaptations possible in Venus's environment that they need for their own purposes
* A long-term plan to use Venus as a staging area for a larger invasion

This approach creates a compelling investigation that builds directly from the players' crash-landing experience while gradually uncovering a much larger threat. It positions Deep Haven as a major revelation rather than a known location, making its discovery a dramatic turning point in your campaign.

Would you like me to develop any particular aspect of this mystery further? Perhaps specific clues they might find at each location, or the exact nature of what the Mysterions are doing beneath Venus's oceans?
