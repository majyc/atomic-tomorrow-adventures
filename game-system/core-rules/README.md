## Manuscript Integration

This content maps to **Volume I - Explorer's Manual** (Core Mechanics section) and **Volume II - Operations Manual** (expanded rules). Suggested integration order:

### Volume I (Essential Rules)
1. Core systems and task resolution
2. Skills system
3. Basic combat
4. Basic social and exploration rules

### Volume II (Advanced Rules)
1. Detailed combat systems (special combat, hit locations)
2. Chase rules and medical system
3. Trade and research systems
4. Specialized reference materials

## Notes for Manuscript Development

- Ensure consistency in dice mechanics across all systems
- Verify that combat rules integrate properly with character attributes
- Consider consolidating overlapping rules between different systems
- Check that medical system aligns with character health mechanics
- Review cheat sheet for completeness and accuracy
