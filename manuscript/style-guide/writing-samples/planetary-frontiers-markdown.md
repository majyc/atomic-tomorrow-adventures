## Reactions

### REACTIONS

When you encounter potentially hostile NPCs or creatures they aren't necessarily going to attack, depending on their purpose in the area and how your party is conducting itself. If you're in enemy territory during wartime and you run into a patrol, a good roll on the reaction table isn't going to save you from a confrontation, but police in a city are unlikely to simply attack you even if they're "Hostile"…though they may look for an excuse to arrest you or run you out of town.

| Roll 2d6 | Reaction NPC/monster | Negotiation |
|---|---|---|
| **2** | Hostile/Attacks | Refuses & opposes (further rolls on locals -1) |
| **3-5** | Unfriendly/may attack | Refuses |
| 6-8 | Neutral/uncertain | Hesitant, may try again with better offer |
| **9-11** | Indifferent/Uninterested | Accepts |
| 12 | Friendly/Enthusiastic friendship | Accepts eagerly (+1 morale if hired) |

## Piracy

Piracy is a tricky proposition in space travel. The point in the journey when a ship carrying valuable cargo is usually farthest from help is the midpoint, but that's also when it's at or near its maximum velocity before it turns around and begins the long process of slowing down. It's mostly just not economical to burn enough fuel to catch up and match velocities, even if pirates could afford engines rated for the kind of Gs that would be needed.

Instead, space pirates, like most pirates in history, lurk around where ships begin and end their journeys, when they are going slowly and making predictable approaches to their ports of call. Since these are the busiest areas, they are also the most heavily patrolled and easiest for pirate hunters to give chase. On the other hand, they are the easiest for a would be pirate to pretend to be just another merchant until they have an opportunity to strike. Nonetheless, pirates are more active in the well-traveled but less densely populated areas like the Asteroid Belt, and in and among the many moons of the Outer Planets, where there are plenty of places to hide ships or even whole pirate bases.

Pirate ships tend to be small, cheap, and fast, and to take on merchants in a swarm; it's hard for a merchant ship to afford enough guns and missiles to fend off dozens of small ships that are barely more than an engine, a cockpit, and a weapon. They favor hit and run tactics, staying only long enough to extract a bribe to let the ship go on its way, or steal a small amount of its most valuable cargo or kidnap somebody for ransom. Pirates aren't going to hang around long enough to transfer large amounts of cargo, or have ships large enough to carry much of it away. Bulk freighters are tempting targets because of their low velocities and predictable minimum energy orbits, but the aim is generally extortion rather than theft. Better pay "tribute" so the ship can go on its way undamaged than risk losing it all if the pirates decide to scuttle it.

There are, of course, famed exploits where pirates have made off with entire ships, but that takes planning and a highly trained crew, a larger pirate ship than most pirates can dream of affording and somewhere to take the ship where pursuers can't easily find it... a tricky task when a ship's engines burning are generally visible all over the Solar System given a powerful enough telescope.

## Pirate Tactics

- Putting the crew and passengers overboard, in life boats or space suits, so pursuers have to rescue them.
- Dropping debris, chaff, or mines in their wake to create navigation hazards
- Using decoy missiles outfitted to confuse pursuers as which drive signatures to track
- Making sure there are near-by bodies they can duck behind to hide trajectory changes (or if there are enough or they're large enough hide on/in)
- Staging multiple simultaneous raids, including decoys, to stretch hunters' thin
- Taking hostages
- Bribing locals for info on shipping, or even having moles

## Space Patrol Tactics

The Space Patrol are the main anti-pirate force in the Solar System, and their small patrol vessels spend a lot of time in 0-G waiting near ports for the call to action. There's no point being under thrust if you might be heading in the exact opposite direction you need to go.

Generally their patrol vessels, despite only having a crew of four, are more heavily armed, capable of sustaining higher thrust, and have better communications than the pirates so a single ship represents a considerable threat to a pirate attack. Pirates will usually run from the Space Patrol; even if they could win an engagement, and even though the SP usually try to take prisoners instead of killing, the cost isn't worth it and should they win it just guarantees more resources devoted to hunting them down. Politically motivated and crazies may stand and fight, but smart pirates know that a successful raid is one where they got there, got some booty, and got out before the SP even arrive.

Since Space Patrol crews always include an Esper, and pirate crews almost never do, the Space Patrol can and will begin to respond to a distress call with contacting other SP patrol vessels via telepathy to converge on the pirates without alerting them via radio chatter. Pirates will sometimes try to jam conventional radio transmissions, but in the absence of solar activity that is suspicious in itself; there is no known way of blocking telepathic contact except by a more powerful telepath and no telepath that passes the rigorous screening and conditioning of the Rhine Institute has ever thrown their lot in with pirates.

The Space Patrol will pay a reward for live Pirates, and nothing for dead ones (too easy to claim a corpse you found or created was a pirate); they will also pay a reward for pirate vessels captured as long as they can be proved to belong to pirates, preferably through some of their crew being captured as well. The reward ranges from 1,000 cr a pirate on up for those that are more infamous. They will pay 5,000 cr+ reward for capturing a pirate ship depending on size and condition; the captors get to keep the ship, the reward is separate. Despite their standing policy for offering rewards, the rank and file Space Patrol don't regard professional bounty hunters with any great fondness. Too many bounty hunters shift back and forth over the line between piracy against pirates and piracy plain and simple.

## Hyper Science

The science and technology described in the rules and setting form a baseline of what is known/common but science is always advancing, at least in these kinds of stories. In fact a startling new discovery is often the seed of an adventure. The Referee should feel free to add new tech either in the hands of allies or invented by a PC that needs testing and investigation or in the hands of rivals or enemies that could doom us all!

Unlike in some other genres, there's no need to return to the status quo ante after an adventure with a new discovery. Galactic Empires might stagnate for a thousand years, but in the techno-optimistic retro future you can build upon what's already been discovered and push the tech of the setting forward into tomorrow.

## Some Potential Discoveries 

- FTL
- FTL radio
- Cloaking Devices
- Shrink rays
- Time travel
- Cloning (with full memories)
- Mind transfer
- Real AI
- New elements with mysterious properties
- Anti-Grav
- Alternate Dimensions
- Matter Transmission

## Limitations on New Discoveries

It's recommended that to keep the feel of the setting from changing too swiftly, any new technologies at least start with pretty significant limitations or restrictions, and let future iterations of the technology expand the capabilities. For instance, perhaps matter transmission at first requires a booth on either side rather than being able to "beam" a target to and from an arbitrary place, and/or be able to transmit from place to place on a planet or to orbit but not as far as to another planet.

## BRainiacs and New Discoveries

One of the things that Brainiac characters ought to be able to do is discover new things on their own, or to be able to modify the hyper science discoveries that they encounter on an adventure. Rather than having a formal system or mini-game for this, I recommend just allowing the player to describe something they want to work on in down time and decide when to work that into an adventure, or start an adventure by presenting them with something they've just discovered in the lab.

## Planetary Hexploration

Exploring strange new worlds is one of the fundamental activities of Planetary Frontiers, but planets are big places. Not as big as space, but the trip down the road to the chemist is still peanuts compared to even a small planet. Preparing for this kind of game play may seem like a daunting task, either requiring impractical levels of preparation or completely relying on procedurally generating things for the players to encounter as they travel. Even if the encounter tables include exciting things that might try to eat them, or valuable finds, players can start to feel that if everything they encounter is random decisions hardly matter. In addition it can be hard to make the world seem densely packed with different things to encounter and explore if there's only one decision per day and it comes from a list of 6 or a dozen of the same thing every time. This can lead to what Larry Niven called the "It was raining on planet Mongo" problem.

The following procedure attempts to thread the needle between the two approaches, to achieve if not the best of both worlds something that draws on the strength of both. You need a hex map, preferably with some known features on it like the explorer's starting point and any major settlements or terrain features like seas, mountains, volcanoes. The map should have numbered hexes or labeled rows and columns so you can record what the explorers found and give everything a sense of permanency.

As part of preparation roll a bunch of random encounters by terrain type using the usual charts; it's good to supplement this by brainstorming situations that the explorers might encounter that would require some sort of decision or allow further investigation. They don't all have to be trouble, but they should present something that's more than just flavor that the explorers can interact with. (I'll be adding some of these to the blog later). Label the card or use a color to distinguish the different terrain types from each other and number the cards or use a code like MM 1 (Martian Mountains 1), VJ 7 (Venusian Jungle 7).

Jot the encounter on the card along with any game mechanics that need to be referenced (stats if it's a creature, a difficulty level for a task, etc.) so you don't have to look them up. Note any probable reactions for creatures (e.g. will flee if reaches <50% HP in combat, or will fight to the death if anyone approaches its eggs).

Add one or two memorable detail(s) to the card to flesh out the encounter: something that a creature is doing, if it's other people what they're doing/why they're there, some hazard or opportunity that's there in addition to the encounter.

Now make sure to spell out at least one choice on the card that the explorers will need to make including the consequences (attempt to cross the broken unstable scree and have to save vs. Ray or take 1d4 HP, or reduce the number of movement points that day by 3 to bypass around it); you don't need to present this formally to the players to guide their choice, but keep it in your pocket if they seem stumped as to their next move.

On the back of the card, add a memorable feature that helps describe the location and would let the explorers recognize it if they ever return. Maybe add a quick sketch-map of the area if that would be helpful.

## Using the Cards

When you roll an encounter, pick the top card from the pile that matches the terrain type and play out the encounter. Jot the hex location on the back of the card; that encounter is now fixed to that location in case the party ever returns that way. Put the card aside. 

At the end of the session you can go through and update a list of all the explored hexes noting which card was found in which hex in case the players ever want to return there. A spreadsheet or word processing doc is good for this. Keep all the used cards together for future reference.

Create some new cards to replace any that were used and add them to the unused pile.

Note that you don't necessarily have to slow down the game to keep consulting the list of what's been found in the hexes so far in order to play; hexes are big places, and it's perfectly ok to draw new cards each time the explorers enter a hex. The records and salient feature are there in case they want to revisit a previous location, say to investigate something further or to access a resource such as water or minerals that they remember are there. If any of the encounter turns up something that should be noticed by anybody entering the hex (or the explorers do something that should make it noticable like building a large structure or setting off a nuke) that probably should be noted on the map.

On the other hand, if you have the list handy and the players are going to places they've been before, you can glance at it to refresh your memory of what was found.

- L5 - Trendoid hipsters
- Mars. Overly rugged individualists, think they live in the Wild West.
- Ganymede. Space Amish. Hicks.
- Venus. Dino ranchers and savages.
- Mercury. Blue collar miners. Hot-headed hard cases.
- Asteroid Belt. Crazed prospectors, space Hillbillies.

## Smoking

Smoking has been rendered medically safe, requiring merely proper filters or for those who roll their own a minor medical procedure to change lung filters about once a quarter. In any case, cancer and emphysema are eminently curable.

It's still a terrible idea in any artificial habitat, and completely taboo aboard spaceships, orbitals, and underwater habitats. Besides the terror of fire, the oils and particulates are at best expensive to clean up and filter and at worst an actual hazard degrading equipment and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure.

Because of this it's become one of the folk traditions that separates spacers from planet dwellers, with the later taking some kind of pride in the fact this is a vice they are free to enjoy that spacers cannot. Terrans may even affect a non-working pipe while aboard space vessels. Tobacco grows well on both Mars and Venus, while marijuana is primarily a Venusian export, Mars being generally too cold and with insufficient sunlight.

Popular brands are:

- Meteor Strikes - Unfiltered, are known for their no-nonsense, straightforward tobacco flavor.
- Sol Malls - long, cigarettes with advanced filtration technology that are popular among planetary settlers.
- Camelopardalis - ultra-thin and futuristic, offering a refined smoking experience.
- Venus Lights - are sleek, elegant cigarettes designed for the sophisticated women.
- Star Cross - offer a cosmic blend of tobacco and unique flavor infusions.

## Breathable Atmospheres

The following bodies have breathable atmospheres (in the game, not real life):

- Mercury (with help)
- Venus
- Terra
- Mars, in the lowlands.
- Titan
- Ganymede

It is known that several of these bodies would not have an atmosphere or it would not be breathable if it weren't for mysterious pyramids left by the Forerunners. Mars had a denser atmosphere before the Martian Masterminds sabotaged the air generators in an attempt to exterminate all other Martian life forms as their own civilization was dying.

## The Mysterians

They claim to hail from a distant star-system, although in the past they claimed to come from Planet X, a counter-Earth always on the far side of the Sun from Terra, before scientists proved that was impossible. They first appeared in 1957, saying they came in peace but actually seeking to capture Earth women to repopulate their dying planet. They were driven off, but returned in secret in their flying saucers to capture humans again and again, before being driven from the Inner System by the brave forces of the Earth Defense Force (which evolved into the Space Patrol) operating from the first Moon Base which became operational in 1970. They no longer communicate with humankind, seeming to prefer to simply take what they want by force.

Today it is believed the Mysterians did originally hail from another star system, although there is debate as to whether they arrived in the Sol System aboard some sort of generation ship or whether they actually have FTL drive as they once claimed. Certainly their flying saucers do not use any sort of conventional drive known to human science, able to hover in an atmosphere and accelerate far beyond speeds human vessels can sustain. On the other hand, none of their saucers has ever been observed transitioning to light speed or otherwise violating fundamental laws of physics; whatever propels them seems to have the same limits human vessels do, even if possessed of some extraordinarily efficient propulsion. Nor do they possess any sort of force field that would render conventional weapons useless. This is what allows human vessels and their weapons to be effective even against their advanced technology.

The Mysterians still prey upon shipping and isolated outposts in the outer system, and occasionally make stealthy raids into the inner system always seeking to capture humans, preferably women. What few corpses of Mysterians have been recovered suggest that human tissues are used as transplants to shore up the Mysterians biological systems, that have been weakened and damaged by radiation and mutation. It has been suggested, however, that humans have never actually seen a true Mysterian, and the Mysterians have been using human stock captured perhaps long ago as slaves or puppets. This would explain the compatibility between human tissue and the captured corpses, although skeptics point out that could be explained as the Forerunners program of panspermia seeding extrasolar planets as well.

Mysterians will always seek to capture or at least retrieve relatively intact bodies, so they eschew the disintegrator beams and terrible heat rays of the martians, favoring stunners and other incapacitating weapons. In space battles they seek to disable their prey, though they will not hesitate to use beam weapons to seek to destroy Space Patrol vessels that interfere.

## The Future Is Capitalist

Although there are some notable communities like Novyy Stalingrad on Luna that are defiantly communist, and plenty of tiny communities that practice some form of socialism within the community if they're not too small to have an economy altogether, most of the Solar System allows private property and ownership of the means of production. You are allowed to own your own spaceship, strike it rich as a prospector in the Belt, build a farm with your own two hands on Ganymede, start a dino ranch on Venus, and so on. If you need money, you're expected to earn it. It is up to the individual communities what they do about the indigent and those unable to provide for themselves; they almost all do something, though in the harsher environments that something may be to ship them off to somewhere else.

Even Terra, with its cradle-to-grave welfare system for the masses, is largely based on free enterprise for those who elect to produce the wealth that it requires for the consumer class, albeit under the regulation and guidance of the Giant Electronic Brain GEB, as directed by the Science Council.

The form of money used universally in the Solar System is the credit, abbreviated Cr, and symbolized by Ꞓ. Ꞓ 1000/month pays for a standard middle-class lifestyle on Luna, the Orbitals, or Terra if you've opted in to the market system. Local polities might have their own currency in addition or instead of credits, but the players generally won't have to worry about exchange rates unless somehow that is the focus of an adventure. E.g. they take on a well-paying job only to find they're paid in the local currency and now they have to figure out how to horse trade so they can fly away with something they can use.

## More Origins

## Space Cadet 

Graduate of the Space Patrol Academy on Luna. Take one skill from either the Crew or Space Ace class; if you take a skill and you also take that class, get a +1 in that skill.

## Venusian Valkyrie

Gen-modded Venusian warrior woman. Originally part of a female separatist political movement that were among the first colonists of Venus. Like many fringe movements, the colony collapsed due to a combination of political infighting and successive generations just being less fervent about the issues that motivated the founders. They continue the traditions of gen-modding and frequently armed service, but mostly pay lip-service to the separatism. At creation Brawn must be their best attribute (ties are permitted).

![Inset from cover of The Black Amazon of Mars by Leigh Brackett](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spaceamazon.jpg?w=426)

## Martian Origins

## Red Martians

Red Martians were already a dying race, driven nearly to extinction by the Martian Masterminds, before the latter tried to wipe out all life on the planet by destroying the atmosphere converters. Now they are only found in the Valles Marineris canyon. A few find their way into space, usually through joining the Space Patrolas an Esper. Red Martians must arrange attributes so that Psi is their highest.

## Green Martians 

Green Martians never really gave up their nomadic lifestyle, and their ability to go for weeks without breathing more than small sips of air from bladders has let them range farther from the canyons with their pockets of air. With actual oxygen tanks and rebreather apparatus they can travel over most of Mars. Unfortunately their herd animals can't do likewise, so those that choose to wander farther afield have had to revert to hunter-gatherers. Some argue they should give up on Mars and move to Venus, because the humans and Red Martians will never find a way to repair the converters and restore the atmosphere. 

Red Martians Brawn score must be at least 2.

## Hospital Station

While most settlements of any size have at least one hospital, ships tend to have a small sick-bay with just what's needed to treat life threatening injuries, and to stabilize patients until they can be brought to a more comprehensive facility. 

The premier such facility is Hospital Station, a space station permanently on a Mars-Venus cycler orbit. The idea is that this guarantees a state-of-the-art medical facility within a couple days of almost anywhere in the inner planets, with medical emergencies being routed to either Hospital Station or Earth depending on which is closer.

A second Hospital Station, which will take the slow Venus/fast Mars cycle as a counterpart to the current fast Venus /slow Mars cycle is currently under construction. 

## Utility Belts

All gear that's intended for use in space, whether shipboard or in EVA comes equipped with a universal socket to clip onto your space suit's utility belt, which has numerous attachment points each with a tether and reel that keeps it out of the way when holstered and puts it under just enough tension that it doesn't drift around and loop or get caught on anything when the gear is in use. The tether will slowly auto-retract if the piece of gear is released, but that behavior can be overridden if for some reason you need to leave the unit free-floating temporarily; caution is advised since that's a good way to get tangled up.

Most space gear will also come with one or more points of attachment that are a combination of weak magnet and stick-it (gekko-like friction micro-grips) that will let you stick the piece of gear against any reasonably flat or magnetic surface and have it adhere at least enough to not be moved by minor air currents or vibration. It won't hold up to any real force or sudden acceleration, so once again a modicum of caution is advised. Most of the time even if it shakes loose it will just be reeled in by the tether.

## Class Rename

RATS have been renamed to Scoundrels, to make it clearer what the archetype is for people unfamiliar with The Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry Harrison. Still recommended reading. I've updated the obvious older posts to reflect the new language.

## New page

There's a new Nav Link up in the right corner that lets you look at the posts in chronological order, which tends to make more sense, starting with things like the stats and classes and the broad strokes of the setting.

## The Future is Atheist

Or at least a-religious. The discovery of the ruins left by the Forerunners, and evidence of the fairly massive scale they intervened in the Solar System before disappearing took the wind out of the sails of most of the major religions. If God created the Universe, he seemed to have sub-contracted the work of creating mankind. Naturally some tried to cast the Forerunners as divine intermediaries, either angelic or demonic, but the ruins and artifacts they left were too prosaic for that to be satisfying for the majority of people. The bulk of humanity just sort of lost interest in religion, while the few diehards generally banded together to create a settlement somewhere off Earth where they could continue their traditions and practices in isolation. Often, as with other isolationist philosophical movements, the following generations drifted back to more mainstream beliefs even if they didn't abandon the old ways altogether.

There is only one organized church, if it can be called that, with any great following: the Church of Universal Siblinghood (Preĝejo de Universala Gefrateco). They preach that all sapient beings are siblings, and rise of sapience is the purpose of the Universe. They are pacifists, at least as far as sapient species go, even claiming that the Martian Masterminds are ultimately siblings of humanity... even if no communication with them has ever been successful. They are mostly understood by the populace at large as a charitable organization, and you can always find a bed and a meal at one of their chapter-houses in almost any civilized area and a surprising number of uncivilized ones if you're down on your luck.

## Space Combat

It's not the ship, it's the crew. Bigger ships can carry more guns and missiles, and be more heavily armored at the cost of maneuverability, but a single good hit to the engines or power plant can render them helpless. Given the expense of construction and fuel, doctrine calls for smaller craft, with the added benefit of being able to send them to cover more territory.

Ships have a maneuver rating and and armor rating that combine to form the ship's armor class (just as an individual character's Dodge and Armor do). Ships lack any Hit Point pool of their own; instead ships use the crew's Hit Points as a buffer against catastrophic damage. This represents the efforts by the pilot, astrogator, engineer(s) and point-defence gunners to stave off damage to the ship's systems. When a ship takes a hit that surpasses its AC, damage is rolled based on the weapon (generally 1d6) and that damage is distributed evenly across the crew at their battle stations. Fractions aren't rounded--if there are more crew than damage some crew will be skipped. 

If any crew-member's HP goes to zero, then the system they were crewing takes damage; it is unusable until repairs are effected. Roll 2d6# Planetary Frontiers

## About

This is a blog for my work in progress sf rpg Planetary Frontiers. To keep things organized, I will be going back and updating old posts as necessary to elaborate on an idea or keep rules consistent. That's possibly frustrating for those reading it as a blog... Maybe I should do new entries to point back to posts with changes.

## 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Blast Off To Adventure!

Welcome to my new blog for a new game: Planetary Frontiers! Why Planetary Frontiers when I already have Zap! Well, besides the fact I like to monkey around with writing game systems, Zap! and the other SFX! games represent a certain approach to gaming that relies very heavily on the game dynamically reflecting the players' expectations of the world and the genre. What you get out of Zap! is very much what you put into it. I like that very much, most of the time, but it has its drawbacks when it comes to settings which are intended to push back against the players' expectations, contain fundamental mysteries, or clamp down hard on what's feasible. It's much easier to run a StarTrek-like game in Zap!, where an engineer can make up some kind of Treknobabble explanation of reversing the polarity of the tachyon flow to get the ship out of trouble than, say, a Firefly-like scenario where if the ship runs out of fuel in the middle of nowhere it's a slow count-down to death unless the players can pull off a miracle. In addition, since characters in Zap! are almost completely customized from the ground up, with no canonical list of abilities, some players find it daunting to come up with a concept and create characters.

Planetary Frontiers is intended to be a much more old-school game experience, with clearly defined attributes, skill and equipment lists, and a character generation system that spells out the players' choices at every step. I also hope to make it broadly compatible with Traveller and maybe even D&D.

## Skills

Skills act as a bonus to the Effort role to accomplish a task. E.g. to bribe somebody is d20 roll with bonus from Cha, then assuming it's not a routine bribe a d6 Effort roll + Bribery skill to wear away at their resistance (typically = 10). Tasks are rated by the Referee according to the level, so to bribe a 3rd level NPC you'd roll against Difficulty 3 on the Tasks table.

## Backgrounds

Backgrounds describe the characters' lives and circumstances before they begin their careers. If it's a profession, it's generally the **parents'** profession. Backgrounds will automatically award certain skills. To begin with, here's a list of common(ish) Backgrounds:

1. **Barbarian** - natives of a low-tech planet that's regressed from a higher tech
2. **Aboriginal** - non-human natives of a low-tech planet
3. **Dirt Farmer** - agricultural workers on a planet that grows crops the old-fashioned way
4. **Colonist** - settlers on a colony world
5. **Refugee** - displaced persons from some catastrophe or war
6. **Prole** - non-administrative workers on an industrialized world
7. **Salaryman** - administrative, managerial or knowledge workers on an industrialized world
8. **Space Colonist** - inhabitants of a space colony
9. **Ship-born** - family of ship's crew (usually large or generation-ship, sometimes small family-owned vessel)
10. **Merchanter** - trading family or clan
11. **Miner/Prospector** - planetary surface or asteroid miners and their families/small time searchers for ore and inhabitable planets
12. **LEO** - law enforcement agents' family
13. **Noble House** - hangers-on (small chance of actual nobility)
14. **Zealot** - inhabitants of world or culture dedicated to the tenets of a particular religion (rarely mainstream, or they wouldn't have bothered to settle their own world or region)
15. **Faculty** - families of faculty or staff of an institution of learning
16. **Military**- families and camp followers of military personnel
17. **Urchin** - no family, grew up on the streets (or equivalent)
18. **Castaway** - survivors or descendant of survivors of a ship-wreck (not necessarily primitive)
19. **Politician** - family and hangers-on of the politically powerful
20. **Criminal** - family of underworld denizens

## Once More Into The Future!

Take a trip to the year 2001, as it ought to have been!

I'm rebooting Zap-Guns And Zero-G! as ~~Ray-Guns and Rockets~~ Planetary Frontiers, and taking it in a more [Raygun Gothic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic) direction. My gaming group is a year or more into using Stars Without Number as a Traveller-esque game, and while it's not perfect (character creation and abilities are a little more complex than I'd like them to be as GM), it's good enough. That leaves me with an unscratched itch for a game set in the wild and wooly solar system as imagined at the dawn of Science Fiction, before all that pesky knowledge about what the worlds of our solar system are really like, how hard we would find it as a species to get out there among them, and how incredibly alone we are in the Universe. So to the burning canyons of Mercury with all that stuff, instead let us return to the future as we once imagined it!

The system will owe a lot to the earliest days of the hobby, as well, when three (or four) classes were enough for anybody and when what mattered wasn't what was on your character sheet, but what was going on in your imagination. With the Referee as the facilitator, of course, so that when you pushed on the world, the world pushed back, and you could experience genuine surprise at what was behind the door you kicked down.

## Attributes

PF uses the following six standard attributes 

- BRAWN
- BRAINS
- CHARM
- GRACE
- GRIT
- GUILE

And one optional Attribute only for psychic characters: PSI

[See Revised Attributes https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/2024/07/16/revised-attributes/](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/2024/07/16/revised-attributes/)

Generally characters roll 2d6+6 in order each attribute except for PSI, for which they roll 3d6. Except where their origin or class indicates otherwise. E.g.

- Espers roll 3d6 for each Attribute except PSI, for which they roll 2d4+10.
- Space Princesses roll 2d4+10 for Charm.
- Barbarians roll 3d6 in order, but get Max HP at 1st level.

Origins may further modify the attribute rolls.

Females roll 2d6 for Brawn and 4d6 for Grace. Players may elect that their female character is genetically modified, in which case they would roll as normal for their origin.

Brawn is size and strength, bonus to melee to-hit and damage, penalty to AC vs ranged weapons

Brains is intelligence and insight

Grace is dexterity and finesse, bonus to missile to-hit and 0-G combat

Charm is ability to favorably impress others.

Grit is ability to power through injury and illness, bonus to Dodge (the ability to ignore grazes and near misses) 

Guile is cunning, and the ability both to fool others and not be fooled by them.

Psi is ability to use and resist psychic powers, bonus to Psychic saves

## Modifiers

Attribute modifiers apply to rolls listed above, and may be called for by the referee to adjudicate certain tasks or actions that are specifically related to an attribute, such as Brawn for Arm Wrestling, or Brains for remembering which keys you saw pressed on a number pad lock.


| Attribute | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| 3-5       | -2    |
| 6-8       | -1    |
| 9-12      | 0     |
| 13-15     | +1    |
| 16-17     | +2    |
| 18        | +3    |

- Asteroid Belt - prospectors, miners, pirates and outcasts
  - Ceres
  - Vesta
  - Pallas
  - Hygiea

The Outer Worlds

Far away and cold, there are mysteries aplenty from the Forerunners out here, but aside from the lucrative hydrogen mines of Jupiter only the bravest or most foolhardy feel it's worth the risk.

- Jupiter - gas giant inhabited by intelligent reclusive cetaceans, source of most of the hydrogen consumed by the rest of the system.
  - IO
  - Europa
  - Ganymede
  - Callisto
- Uranus
  - Oberon
  - Titania

## My Retro-Future Pintrest

https://www.pinterest.com/jmacy0867/retro-futurism/

## Planetary Frontiers

At the suggestion of the gang at Wandering DM's Discord server, and in particular user @Baquies, I've decided to call this project Planetary Frontiers, since Rayguns and Rockets is a bit clunky and there's also a Rayguns and Rocketships board game which is a little too close for comfort.

## Origins

- **Terran** - The baseline human of the setting, the civilized genetically enhanced and eugenically curated. Can't start with Grit higher than 1, can't start with minuses.
- **Exile** - Terran who has been invited to leave for being a misfit. Normal Grit instead of usual Terran, one extra skill for free, can start with minuses.
- **Loonie** - Born and raised on Luna, physically frailer than the baseline (-1 Brawn). Gets a Vacc-Suit and Vacc-Suit skill for free.
- **Space Princess** - Heir to a decadent alien civilization, which may or may not still possess some secrets of its mighty ancestors. +1 Charm. Gets either one psychic power or one roll on the Alien Artifact table for free.
- **Barbarian** - Rugged survivor, raised in the extra-terrestrial wild-lands, untouched by modern genetic and eugenic techniques. Hit die is one size higher than normal for their class.
- **Belter** - Born and raised in Zero-G, physically frailer than the baseline (-1 Brawn), get Zero-G skill for free.
- **Venusian** - The vast jungles of Venus are occupied by numerous intelligent species, and many Forerunner ruins. Brainiacs speculate that many if not all of Venus' inhabitants' ancestors were originally brought there by the Forerunners. Among the known species are Leopard Women, Dragons, and Sleestak.

## Books

1. Spacers & Psionics
2. Life-Forms & Loot
3. Space & Planetary Adventures

## Saving Throws

Characters get a modifier to their base saving throw target according to the category of the save. When making a save roll d20+Level vs. the base save for your class and modifier for that category. E.g. a Spacer has a base save of 13, so at 1st level would roll d20+1 trying to score a 13 or better for a death save, but a 14 or better for a Ray save, up to a 17 or better for a Psi save.

The referee will ask for an appropriate save based on the closest analogy if there's nothing exactly on point. Saves are generally used when whether an attack or hazard affects the character is a matter of the character's reflexes or resilience instead of an opponent's accuracy.

| Category | Extra Difficulty |
|----------|------------------|
| Death/Poison | +0 |
| Rays (cone attacks) | +1 |
| Explosions (surprises) | +2 |
| Beams (continuous/area attacks) | +3 |
| Psionic Powers | +4 |

Roll 1d20+Level vs. Save number based on your class and bonus for that category.

## Saving Throws and Hit Points

If you fail a save on something that will kill a character, the character automatically spends Hit Points to increase the saving roll (1 HP for +1 to the roll) to change the save to a passing one; if the character doesn't have enough hit points to cover the gap, the save fails regardless and the HP aren't spent.

If the character has failed a save and is under a continuous effect like Mental Domination, each round the player has the option of spending 1 Hit Point to try the save again. If HP are reduced to 0 this way the character doesn't immediately roll for an injury, but ceases to be able to resist until and unless some HP are recovered.

## Welcome to the World of Tomorrow

![Welcome to the World of Tomorrow - Futurama Episode 1](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/worldoftomorrow.gif?w=220)

## Space Travel

Space Travel takes place using rockets, of the needle-nosed, standing on the tail variety. Only the Mysterians use saucer-shaped vessels, propelled by unknown means. Travel between the planets takes days, weeks for the Outer System, and rockets travel at whatever speed it takes to make that happen.

Most travel takes place under constant thrust to give at least low gravity along the ships axis, though probably not a full G (which would reduce travel times to hours, assuming sufficiently energetic and efficient fuel could be hand-waved).

Rockets do need to refuel, but probably will not run out of fuel mid-journey unless they've suffered some damage or taken an unexpectedly long detour. Rocket exhaust is dangerous if you get in the way of the burn, but doesn't emit enough radiation or poisons that it's necessary to only land them in barren areas or pose a hazard for centuries to come.

Rocket sizes range from small one-person ships to relatively huge passenger liners and cargo vessels; nothing the size of a city, but capable of carrying several hundred people comfortably or even luxuriously.

![](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rocketshipblastoff.png?w=682)

## Robots

Artificial intelligence has so far proved impossible, so all robots and computers are not self-aware and lack volition. They follow orders and when not carrying out an order suspend their operations.

Robots come in two basic varieties, smart robots with positronic brains who follow the Three Laws, and more primitive dumb robots without.

On civilized planets, construction or importation of non-positronic brain robots is strictly limited to non-critical areas where there is no possible interaction with humans other than the robot's operators. In practice that means you could have a dumb robot forklift in an automated factory, but you would need a smart robot to staff a ticket counter at a space port.

Most ships, even technically one-man jobs, will have a positronic brain robot to provide backup to the pilot operator.

The largest purveyor of robots is General Robotics, founded by the inventor of the positronic brain.

GEB, the Giant Electronic Brain of the Terran Science Council, is a positronic robot.

## Terra

![Utopian Promise](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pursuitpromise_1.webp?w=350)

Terra is a non-ironic Utopian technocratic society, run on utilitarian/consequentialist grounds which enforces conformity by exiling misfits and malcontents to space. This is not seen, by Terrans, as a punishment, merely an attempt to adjust circumstances of those unfortunate enough not to fit in with the Terran ethos in the way that's least disruptive to society. Those who nonetheless wish to stay are given a choice between psychological intervention to help them fit in, or self-isolation to one of the areas of the planet reserved for communities who cannot or will not get with the program.

Most Terrans live in one of the mega-cities: New Ark, New Angeles, London, New Paris, New New Delhi, Neo Tokyo, New Beijing, etc. The rest of the planet has largely returned to park and wilderness areas, as the outflow of migrants depopulated much of the planet while simultaneously most heavy industry moved to orbit. Power is provided by safe, clean, efficient nuclear energy, while robots and automated systems do almost all of the dangerous or mindless, tedious physical work.

Terra of 2001 has banished all poverty, sickness and war. Violent crime is nearly non-existent due to continuous cradle-to-grave monitoring of all citizens. The world is united under a single benevolent government called the Terran Establishment, guided by the Science Council with the assistance of GEB, the Giant Electronic Brain in charge of planning the economy. The economy is nominally capitalist, in that private property and private enterprise are not per-se forbidden, but is under such tight regulation that most enterprises choose to incorporate elsewhere, particularly in the Lunar Free State.

Every citizen receives a basic stipend but is required to work at the job they are most suited to perform, according to a battery of tests including psychological tests administered throughout their education. They must fulfill their duties as citizens, including marriage and children by certain specific ages, unless granted exemptions due to the nature of their work. The stipend is sufficient to cover all basic needs: food in pill form, generic housing, clothing, etc. Such medical needs as people have after the elimination of bacterial and viral diseases, and genetic defects, tend to be injuries or exposure to toxic substances that can be treated cheaply and efficiently by auto-docs, and treatment is covered by the state.

Those who voluntarily renounce their citizenship, or who are convicted of Bohemianism, are given one-way tickets to the Inner-system destination of their choice. Those with exceptional qualifications or special talents may be forwarded to one of the services such as the Space Rangers, or Interplanetary Rescue while still retaining their Terran citizenship.

Terra is by design a place for characters to be from, rather than somewhere to go in order to adventure.

## Luna

![Photo of full moon by Neven Krcmarek](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/neven-krcmarek-9dtg44qhx1q-unsplash.jpg?w=300)

The oldest human colony, the only one whose settlement pre-dated the unification of Earth into the Terran Establishment, it has three major cities, based around the original settlements of Luna City, Tsiolkovsky Gorod, and Oberthstadt. Luna City is the capitol of the Lunar Free State, the largest and most populous of the current lunar settlements, though there are hundreds if not thousands of smaller settlements scattered over the light side of the moon, as well as a handful including some research facilities on the dark side.

Most Lunar settlements are well underground, with the Lunar surface regulating their temperature and shielding them from radiation and meteorite strikes. Water and oxygen are both easy to extract from Lunar soil, and the long Lunar days and lack of atmosphere make solar power a reasonably reliable and cheap supplement to their nuclear plants. Lunar hydroponics are second to none in the Solar System, and form a substantial part of their exports to the outer planets, and unlike Terrans Loonies have never taken to the "pill and paste" meal.

Luna City is located in Tycho crater near the original moon landing site in the sea of Tranquility, while Novyy Stalingrad is in Langrenus crater, and Oberthstadt to the Lunar West in Copernicus crater. Positioning the major settlements within the crater walls offers some engineering benefits in digging the underground cities as well as some minor protection from glancing impacts by meteorites. Luna City is the only fully-domed city of the major cities of Luna, and is the home of the Lunar Government, Port Tycho, the single largest space port in the Solar System, and the main campus of the Rhine Institute, providers of training and certification for all licensed Espers in the System. Novyy Stalingrad discourages visitors and little is known about its current conditions.

Generally speaking the Loonies are allergic to central authority, with the War for Lunar Freedom being a touchstone of their culture despite it happening over sixty years prior, and most of the recent immigrants being exiles from Terra thanks to its policy of exiling misfits and malcontents. The War for Lunar Freedom's proximate cause was the Tranquility Massacre, when Terran forces asphyxiated over 200 hundred protesters encamped in the Tranquility dome as a protest against the new Terran policy of mandatory genetic screening; it ended when the League of Earth government was dissolved and reformed into the current Terran Establishment under pressure from the defections of member states seeking to end the bombardment of Earth from the Lunar rebel's mass-drivers.

The Loonies devolve political authority to the most local level practical, with the different settlements all being semi-autonomous and organized in a variety of different fashions. Luna City itself is organized as a municipality with an elected Mayor and City Council, while Tsiolkovsky Gorod, renamed to Novyy Stalingrad in the 1940s is the last holdout in the system of old-style Stalinist communism. Smaller settlements can consist of single families or more extended clans, or are organized as limited liability corporations, partnerships, artists' collectives, anarcho-syndicalist communes, and so on. Many only last a few years, or a single generation, before proving impractical or the founders' children turning out to have no particular desire to carry on their parents' political experiments. But as the popular Loonie saying goes "Tain't Nobody's Business But Their Own" (TNBBTO).

On matters affecting the entire moon, such as orbital traffic control, mutual defense, and inter-settlement law they choose a governing committee by moot of all adult citizens. In order to ensure that the Executive is merely carrying out policies agreed upon by the committees, Executive power lies with the Giant Electronic Brain Watson, which as a positronic brain lacks volition and self-awareness and is incapable of having an agenda of its own. Judicial authority rests with magistrates selected by lottery from qualified adult citizens, with the aid of Watson for the legal niceties.

Committee purviews are strictly limited to the matter brought to moot, and there are multiple committees each with their own area of responsibility in operation at the same time. Coordination is handled by Watson, and disagreements are brought back to the moot.

The Lunar Constitution guarantees all citizens, regardless of their local polity, the right to participate in the moot, the right of exit to another polity or of the moon altogether.

Luna is home-base to many corporations that operate in the Solar System, among the largest being General Robotics, Pan-Am, and Mitsubishi Rocket Works, both because of its convenience in proximity to Terra with much more reasonable energy-to-orbit requirements and its relatively laissez-faire legal system that adds few burdens on top of whatever local regulations they have to abide by in the other locales they do business.

Luna is also one of the main bases of the Space Patrol, going all the way back to the first Patrol Moon Base established as a forward post and launching point against the height of Mysterian activity on Terra in the early 1970's. Patrol Base Alpha is located slightly South-West of Oberthstadt, in Kepler crater.

Loonies have the option to gen-modify themselves, in order to avoid the difficulties they face in visiting or working in the 1G environments that humans favor in most of the rest of the system. The gen-modifications strengthen their bones and muscles to put them on par with Terrans, but have the side effect of turning their hair purple and metallic. The treatment is expensive, so most Loonies won't bother with it unless they plan to spend significant time off of Luna; the treatment is free for members of the Space Patrol, so it is common for them to get it regardless.

**Charm Animal**: (Duration: 1 day) as with Charm Person, but with animals.

**Empathic Analysis**: (Duration: Concentration) detect the basic alignment of a sentient being along the axes Conscientious/Obedient <-> Impulsive/Anarchic and Altruistic/Empathetic <-> Selfish/Callous.

**ESP**: (Duration: 6 turns) You can read the surface thoughts of other sentient creatures. This lets you detect creatures on the other side of a door. Concentration is required when you are actively sensing.

**Illusion**: (Duration: 6 turns) You create a visual illusion of your choice. You can move the illusion within the range of the power. It disappears if hit in melee (Dodge 10)

**Invisibility**: (Duration: 6 turns) Concentration, up to Psi Bonus targets at once. You vanish one creature or object from sight. An invisible creature sees itself hazily. Dropped items become visible, and the effect ends if the subject attacks any creature.

**Levitation**: (Duration: 12 turns) Self only. You can move up or down through the air at will. Vertical speed is 6" per round. You cannot move horizontally, but can push along the face of a cliff or a ceiling.

**Psionic Paralysis**: (Duration: 9 Turns) The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Held creatures automatically fail on their saving throws vs. Rays, Beams, and Explosions, but otherwise save normally.

**Psychometry**: (Duration: 3 turns) You sense the direction of a well-known object. You can search for general items such as an pistol or a door, in which case you locate the nearest one of its type. Attempting to find a specific item requires an accurate mental image.

## Tasks Table

Tasks are non-combat activities the characters might be trying to perform where success is doubtful, and a reasonably competent individual of a given level has a 50-50 shot or worse. Examples might be bypassing the security system of an airlock, performing surgery on an injury, or safely landing an aircraft that's taken damage. 

The Target Number for accomplishing a Task is equal to the Difficulty level assigned by the referee; for affecting other creatures that's generally their Hit Dice. Roll 2d6 plus the attribute bonus, if any, to meet or beat the Target Number.

The formula is TN = 7 + 2 * the characters level - the difficulty; if the result is < 7 then it's an Automatic success with no need to roll; if the result is < 3 it's a Critical success; if the result is > 11 the feat is impossible even if the character has bonuses that would count. If the character's class is unrelated to the task, the character uses the 0 column.

Characters don't add their skill as a modifier to the success roll, instead they add it to their effort roll. Class levels count more than specific skills for basic pass/fail tests.

Expressed as a chart, it looks like this:

|            | Character Level |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Difficulty | 0       | **_1_** | **_2_** | **_3_** | **_4_** | **_5_** | **_6_** | **_7_** | **_8_** |
| 1          | 9       | 7     | 5     | A     | C     | C     | C     | C     | C     |
| 2          | 11      | 9     | 7     | A     | A     | C     | C     | C     | C     |
| 3          | -       | 11    | 9     | 7     | A     | A     | C     | C     | C     |

A = Automatic success, C = Critical Success, - = Impossible

## Basic Combat

Characters have Dodge 10 plus any modifiers from Grit; this is the base Target Number needed on a d20 to hit them with any weapon.

To hit a character you have to meet or beat their Dodge on d20 + Attack + modifiers from Brawn for melee or Grace for ranged. To **hurt** a character with most weapons, however, you have to exceed their Dodge by as much or more than their Armor. A character who is hit but not hurt may still be subject to other effects from the attack, such as being knocked over by a force beam or slowed by a cold beam.

When a character is hurt, roll the damage dice for the weapon type. For melee attacks add the attacker's Brawn modifier as well. The result is the number of Hit Points to take off the character's total; when Hit Points reach 0 the character is incapacitated and dying.

## Rounds

Action is broken into rounds of 10 seconds each; on each character's turn they can move and attack in that order at no penalty; if they want to shoot before or during a move they suffer a penalty based on the distance moved. Characters must stand still in order to use a psionic power or a crewed weapon; characters that move and fire a ranged weapon suffer a penalty of -2 on their to-hit roll per 2m (1" scale or 2 paces) moved. The penalty is applied based on the entire distance of the move, not just the part before firing, counting as a minimum of 1" before and after firing regardless of actual distance. E.g. popping out from behind cover just long enough to fire and then popping back counts as 2" for the turn, which is a -4 penalty on the shot. Running 2", shooting, and then ducking behind some other cover would count as 3", or -6 to the shot, etc. You cannot use melee weapons in this way unless you are mounted, in which case you apply the penalty based on the mount's movement.

## Initiative

Action goes around the table. Each character rolls d20 at the start of combat to see which character goes first, after which they go clockwise around. Within a side, order is arbitrary.

Action by all characters and both sides is considered happening simultaneously; breaking it into sequence is purely for convenience and to make sure nobody gets missed. That means that in order to wait to see what another character does, you actually have to wait and possibly miss your turn.

## Waiting

If you want to react to the turn of somebody going later in the round, such as when they're behind cover and you want to shoot them if they show themselves you can Wait. You save your action and can then can try to Interrupt (Roll off d6 +Grace vs d6 + Grace, higher score goes first). If you try to interrupt and fail, or you wait and the round ends without you interrupting anybody, your action still happens if it makes sense (you shoot the badguy after he flips the switch) or is skipped if it doesn't (you tried to close the door before he came though but were too slow).

## Retreating

There's no penalty for retreating from melee on your turn, foes do not get a "parting shot" unless they succeed in trying to interrupt your retreat (in which case if you survive you would still get to move away, and since they've already acted they don't get to move after you).

## Critical Hits

On any attack that does damage, it's a critical hit if you roll the max on the damage die (e.g. 6 on a d6, 4 on a d4, etc.) Roll again and add, keep doing so until you stop getting the max on the die.

## Basic Ranged Combat

## Ranges

Melee weapons can only be used at arms length. Thrown weapons are a -1 to hit for every 2 meters (1") distance. Primitive ranged weapons such as bows are -1 to hit for every 4 meters (2") distance. Modern ranged weapons such as blast pistols have ranges and modifiers of point blank (up to 2" away) +2, short (up to 10") +0, medium (up to 20") -2, and long (anything beyond that) -8. For comparison a 21st century pistol competition would typically be done at 15" or 30". Rifle weapons would count anything less than 180" as short, so modifiers are irrelevant for most combats. These are all approximate and in most cases in theater of the mind play you would only use the range categories.

## Point Blank Shots

Point blank shots with modern weapons always count as criticals: no matter what is rolled on the first die, roll again and add. On subsequent rolls only keep rolling if you score the max on the die.

## Ray Weapons

Ray Weapons shoot a cone of energy covering about a 60 degree arc in front of you, with exact effect depending on the weapon (Stun, Damage, Freeze, etc.) Instead of rolling to hit with a Ray Weapon, the target(s) must make a saving throw against Rays. The Attack Bonus with a Ray Weapon (including any modifiers from Grace for ranged weapons) becomes the number of targets you can hit with the ray, minimum of one even if you have penalties. Range modifiers for point-blank, short, medium, and long ranges become modifiers to the die roll of the Saving Throw as the ray becomes more attenuated with distance. You cannot skip targets that fall within the arc of the ray, so be careful of friendly fire.

## Beam Weapons

Beam weapons are capable of firing continuous beams that can be swept over an area or "tracked" onto a target. Again, instead of rolling to hit, the target has to make a save against Beams. However, unlike Ray weapons, Beam weapons have to divide the damage rolled against all the targets (whether or not they made their save, though those that make the save don't suffer any ill effects). For every +1 to-hit that the attacker has, 1d6 is added to the amount of damage before dividing, representing the attacker's ability to keep the beam on target longer despite its attempts to evade; the number of dice added can't exceed the number of targets who fail the save... at best the expert shooting with a Beam weapon will do the same as its base damage to a target. A skillful user of a Beam weapon can also skip targets; a skipped target still counts as a target for dividing damage and for number of targets the attack bonus allows but they don't get hit or suffer any effects of the beam.

## Auto-Fire Weapons

Auto-fire weapons (pulsers, machine guns, etc.) fire multiple discrete shots. The advantage over a Beam weapon is that each shot that hits does full damage instead of being spread out; the disadvantage is that the attack does have to roll to-hit. The attack is rolled once, and then is resolved against each target with each successive target applying a -2 to the roll before it's evaluated. Each weapon will list the number of shots in the burst, which is the max number of targets you can hit. You *cannot* skip targets with Auto-fire weapons, but you can elect to make more than one attack on a given target, possibly exhausting the burst before you hit every target the weapon could have.

## Explosions

Explosions, whether caused by grenades or equipment blowing up require a Save vs. Explosion or half-damage. For every 1" the target is away from the center of the explosion, they get a +1 on the Saving Roll.

## Saving Throws

A successful save against a ranged weapon or explosion leaves you prone and/or behind cover, as appropriate. Being prone does not make you unable to use a modern ranged weapon, or unable to make further saves (you can roll) but you will have to stand to use a primitive weapon or to move at more than a crawl (2").

## Grenades

To land a grenade where you want roll an attack against Target 10; the grenade goes off and anyone within the radius defined by the grenade must make a saving throw against Explosions.

If you *miss* with your initial attack, roll 2d6. The die showing the *lower* number is how many inches you missed by; doubles indicates you got lucky and it landed where you wanted anyway. The die showing the *higher* number indicates the direction it went. For every 2m (1" scale) the grenade missed by, targets in the center get a +1 on their saving roll; other targets should be adjusted by whether the grenade landed closer or farther away.

![Compass rose, numbered from 2 in the South to 6 in the North](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/grenade.png?w=400)

If the higher die is on the right, it went right, on the left and it went left.

## Less Basic Combat

While as a general rule, players should feel free to try anything they like in combat and the referee should try to come up with a result that makes sense or perhaps do a simple task roll or contest if it's not clear what the result ought to be, some situations come up often enough or are tricky enough to fit into the somewhat abstract combat system that it's useful to have a rule handy to resolve it.

## Simple Maneuvers

In order to perform a combat maneuver such as tripping or disarming a foe, forcing them to take a step back, or any other situation that forces their hand or gives you a tactical advantage, declare your intent to do so and roll an ordinary attack; if you roll well enough to hurt them they now have the option of either yielding to your intent (dropping the weapon, stepping back or whatever) *or* they can just take the damage. They must make this decision before the damage is rolled.

In most cases, a 1st level NPC will choose to go along, rather than risk a hit that can end their life. Only if they stand to lose something more important to them than their life would it be worth it. A higher level NPC might be more inclined to resist and just bear the damage, but as the fight goes on the balance of risk can change.

## Getting the Drop on Someone

A slight variation of this is that if you are at point blank range and not in combat yet, you can merely threaten to shoot someone in order to get them to surrender. Roll to hit as if you were going to shoot, and if you score enough to hurt them you can then threaten to do so if they don't comply with your instructions. As long as you keep your weapon on them and stay at point blank range then at any point if they stop complying you can jump directly to inflicting damage. Remember that at point blank range a modern ranged weapon automatically inflicts critical damage, which is to say you roll damage and immediately roll again, adding the damage as long as you keep scoring the highest roll possible on the die. NPCs will almost always go along when somebody has the drop on them, hoping for an opportunity to dodge if their captor gets distracted.

## Psionics

## Unlocking Powers

Espers get a set of psionic powers as they level up, with the only way to get more powers being to increase in level. At each level an Esper gets one more randomly-determined power of each Rank of powers they currently can access. They access new Ranks every odd level, starting at 1. When unlocking a new Rank, they automatically get that rank's signature power, one power of their choice, and one random power.

When rolling for a new random power, if a power comes up they have already unlocked they get to choose one instead. This means that as they level they will tend to have more choice over what they unlock, and also eventually they can expect to learn most of the powers at a given Rank, at least for the lower Ranks.

## Using Powers

Using psionic powers is very taxing on an Esper's brain, and repeated use of powers will eventually burn out the Esper's abilities for the day. An Esper can use whatever powers they know as many times as they like, but each time they do so they run the risk of burn out. Every time an Esper uses a power they have to make a Task check of their level vs. the power's difficulty (always 2 x the Rank of the power); a failed check means the power works, but they've burned out their Psi abilities for the day. Unlike most checks, rolling a 2 is always a failure, so the Esper must roll 2d6 even if the target is A (automatic). Once they've burned out their abilities they can't use them until they've had 8 hours of sleep or meditation, though there are certain drugs that can reduce or eliminate this period (at the risk of long-term damage). E.g. a 1st level Psychic must roll 2d6 + Psi Mods vs. Difficulty 2 to use one of their first-rank powers (needing 9+ on the roll to succeed). A 2nd level Esper trying the same test would only need a 7+ to succeed, while a 3rd level Esper would only burn out a 1st rank power if they rolled a 2 (snake eyes).

## Saving Throws

Most psionic powers that are used on others allow for them to make a saving throw against Psi. Powers used on yourself or a willing subject don't require a save. Burn-out has no effect on the saving throw; even if the Espers burned out their abilities in the attempt, the power still worked and the target needs to save.

## Range

All psionic powers are line-of-sight, but require the Esper to clearly sense the target, either through a psionic power or visually, preferably through seeing the target's eyes. Range modifiers are applied to the save, not the power activation, and are the same as for ranged weapons, unless a psi sense is used. Sensory powers can operate through intervening barriers, and are only limited by line of sight, though they are still limited to the ranges at which the Esper could see if there was no barrier. Psionic powers can operate against anyone the Esper can sense, but they do have to sense them first (e.g. Psionic Slumber could used on a guard on the far side of a closed door, once Sense Mind has been used to detect the guard). They cannot work over technological links, e.g. an Esper can't use psionic powers against someone just because they're on a TV screen the Esper can see. Espers can boost their senses beyond line of sight at the cost of increasing the difficulty of the burn-out test by 1 for each increase in double the radius covered (assume 6km is the base line of sight).

E.g. the Esper can see a target who is 30' (6") away... the modifier to the target's save would be +5. If the Esper first uses sense mind, for which there is no range modifier, then a subsequent attempt to target that person with say Psionic Slumber, would also have no modifiers.

## Ammunition

All the standard guns work on charges from batteries; batteries are not interchangeable, and a bolt will use 1 charge, a beam 2, and a ray 3; rifles use the same number of charges, but from rifle packs.

| Type | Charges | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Pistol | 30 | 10 |
| Rifle | 30 | 20 |

## Primitive Weapons And Armor

## Weapons

Cost listed after the semi-colon is for primitive society, or 1cr in a modern society (unless it's a genuine antique instead of a replica).

All modern armor is doubled against primitive weapons, even if that means the primitive weapon can't hurt the wearer at all. A 20 doesn't count as automatic if it takes 20+ to hurt.

| Type | Light | Medium | Heavy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sword | Dagger (1d4;3) | Sword (1d8;10) | 2-h Sword (1d10;15) |
| Spear | Spear (1d6;1) | Polearm (1d8;7) | Lance/Pike (1d8;4)* |
| Axe | Hand Axe (1d6;3) | Battle Axe (1d8;7) | Halberd (1d10;7) |
| Club | Mace (1d6;5) | Morning Star (1d8;6) | Flail (1d8;8)** |

Primitive Melee Weapons

Types: Swords can be drawn and used in a single round. Spears can be used to attack from a second rank. Axes get +2 to hit targets in medium or heavy primitive armor. Clubs get +4 to hit heavy primitive armor.

Lances do double damage when used from a charging mount; pikes get double damage when set against such a charge. (*) Flails ignore any opponent primitive shield bonuses. (**)

## Bows and Other Missiles

| Type | Damage | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Sling | 1d4 | 3 |
| Short Bow | 1d6 | 25 |
| Long Bow | 1d6 | 40 |
| Composite Bow | 1d8 | 50 |
| Light Crossbow* | 1d6 | 15 |
| Heavy Crossbow** | 1d10 | 25 |

Primitive Bows

Slow - fires at the end of the round (*) Very Slow - fires every other round (**)

## Armor

| Type | Bonus | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Leather | +2 | 20sp |
| Chainmail | +4 | 40sp |
| Plate | +6 | 60sp |
| Shield | +1 | 10sp |

Primitive Armor

Bonus is how much you have to beat the base Dodge score in order to hurt the foe and not just bounce off the armor. Cost is 1cr for any if bought in a modern society, unless genuine antique.

## Zero-G Combat

Your ranks in the skill Zero-G act as a hard limit on your attack bonus in Zero‐G. If you don't have that skill, you can only hit by accident (roll 20 on a d20). In addition there is no to-hit bonus for Brawn, even in melee, and the damage bonus only applies when wrestling. Grace modifies to-hit in melee (unlike in gravity) as well as its usual modifier to AC

Your ranks also act as a limit in the positive modifiers Grace applies (negative modifiers apply normally). E.g. If your Grace usually applies +2, but your Zero-G skill is only 1, you only get +1.

## Martian Fauna

Most Martian fauna are hexapodal or decapodal.

- **Apt**: A large white-furred arctic creature with six limbs, four being legs, which give it rapid speed, and two being arms with hairless hands, with which it grasps prey. It has tusks growing from its lower jawbone, and large faceted, insect-like eyes. Armor 7, HD 10
- **Banth**: It has a long, sleek body, with ten legs, and large jaws equipped with several rows of sharp fangs in a mouth which extends back almost to its small ears. It is mostly hairless, except for a thick mane around the neck. It has large, protruding green eyes Armor 8, HD 11
- **Calot**: A large dog-like creature with a frog-like mouth, and three rows of teeth and ten short legs. Armor 3, HD 2
- **Darseen**: any of a number of chameleon-like reptiles, usually venomous. Armor 5, HD 1-6. 
- **Darseen**, Giant Albino: Armor 5, HD 6
- **Malagor**: Enormous marsh-bird. Armor 5, HD 4
- **Orluk**: An Arctic predator with a black and yellow striped coat. Armor 6, HD 5
- **Plant-man**: They are between 10 and 12 feet in height when upright, with hairless bodies similar in form to humans, excepting broad flat feet which are 3 feet in length and a 6-foot tail, which tapers from a round profile to a flat blade shape at the tip. They also have short, sinuous arms similar to elephant trunks, ending with taloned hands with mouths set in the palms. Their faces are without mouths, with a nose like an open wound, a single white eye surrounded by a white band, and black hair 10 to 12 inches long, each strand similar in thickness to an earthworm. Despite being called men, they do not appear to be intelligent or form any sort of pack or social grouping. Armor 5, HD 6
- **Rykor:** Headless humanoid servitor race bred by the ancient Martians. Armor 0, HD 1
- **Sith**: A giant, venomous hornet-like insect. Armor 9, HD 6
- **Sorak**: A small, cat-like creature. Dodge 12, Armor 0, HD 1/2 
- **Thoat**: An eight-legged horse-like creature with a wide, flat tail. Armor 2, HD 4
- **Ulsio:** Dog-sized burrowing rat-like creature.
- **White Ape**: Huge and ferocious, semi-intelligent gorilla-like creatures with an extra set of arms. Armor 6, HD 8
- **Zitidar**: A draft animal similar to a mastodon. Armor 7, HD 10

## Moons With Atmospheres

Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, Io, *(Jupiter)*, Dione, Enceladus, Rhea, and Titan *(Saturn)*, Triton (Neptune) and Titania *(Uranus)*. In the solar system of Planetary Frontiers, all of these have atmospheres dense enough to matter, and some of them are breathable, or breathable with assistance.

## The Future Is Analog

In Planetary Frontiers, tech is switches, knobs, dials and levers instead of iPads and completely digital touch screens. Not just because that fits the retro vibe, but also as a practical matter... in space, the blue screen of death can be literally that for the entire crew. Space is harsh on electronics, what with solar flares, ion storms, and the nearest chip fabrication plant 3 AU away. You can't afford a single failure taking out the entire controls of your ship; as much as possible everything needs to be separate controls that can be repaired or replaced individually with the skills and materials available to (possibly) a single crew-member. Ideally you can run the essential operations, at least the life-support, of the ship even if all the electronics are fried, if not indefinitely then long enough to repair or replace them.

There are actual physical view-ports, periscopes and optical telescopes because you don't want to be blind if your big TV fails, hatches that at least can be cranked open and shut manually if the electronics fail so you don't get stuck on the far side of a door from the part of the ship that needs repair... or has the tools and materials to carry out the repairs.

Of course, planet-side the need for simplicity and reparability isn't as stringent, and there you can find a lot of systems with more virtual interfaces and non-user-serviceable components.

## Corporations

Not your omni-malevolent cyberpunk Mega-Corps, just businesses supplying goods and services, trying to make a space-buck. They fly the passenger liners and cargo ships that the space-pirates target, they build the gizmos and gear that the PCs need. They might hire the PCs, or the PCs might be assigned to protect them from bandits and marauders targeting them. In some cases, some might be up to shenanigans, and either skirt the law or try to take advantage of it; some might even be in cahoots with space pirates or be willing to sell humanity out to the Mysterians, but by and large they're just part of the civilization that organizations like the Space Patrol are trying to protect.

Among the prominent businesses of the system are:

- **PanAm** - Space liners and particularly orbital shuttles
- **Smith & Westinghouse** - Makers of the finest zap guns.
- **General Robotics** - Premier manufacturers of positronic robots
- **MarsCorp** - Originally chartered to terraform Mars, but that project was put on hold when native Martians other than the Martian Masterminds were discovered. Now barely hanging on, on the basis of their charter monopoly of shipping through MarsPort
- **Paradigm Labs** - Where the Future is Tomorrow! Cutting edge tech and beyond; most likely to be involved in esoteric experiments involving FTL, time-travel, alternate dimensions, and the like.
- **Mitsubishi Rocket Works** - Rockets and other fine space-craft.
- **TruPonics** - Food for the Space Age! Animal Free, Chemical Free, Soylent Free! Colonists everywhere rely on TruPonics!
- **Soylent Sustainables, Inc.** - 100% Post Consumer! Everything a Body Needs! Made with Ingredients!
- **Utonium Industries** - Original inventors of, and still the largest manufacturers of, Chemical X, the only fuel capable of delivering the low-cost high-thrust continuous burn that makes modern space travel possible.
- **Barnum Broadcasting Corporation** - For all your infotainment needs.
- **Tyler Chemical** - Makers of Miraclo! The only vitamin supplement proven to prevent bone-density loss and muscle atrophy in low-G environments! Now in Venusian Mallow-fruit flavor!
- **Solar Lines** - travel the inner planets in luxury

## Interplanetary Travel

The following is for hiking around the unexplored areas of the various planets in the Solar System, ignoring vehicular travel and settled areas for now.

Through the miracle of Rocket Fuel X, ships in Planetary Frontiers are capable of maintaining 1G acceleration throughout their journey with a turn-over halfway, although they do have to refuel at each end. **Note**: Guesstimate travel times between Earth and the other planets are now in another post, since I noticed an error in the calculations I originally posted here.

These times represent the estimated travel times from Earth to each celestial body assuming continuous acceleration at 1G for half the distance and deceleration at 1G for the remaining half, with no relativistic effects considered.

Obviously in terms of real-world science this wouldn't work, the distances vary wildly and there's no hypothetical rocket or fuel that could fit the bill. But in our glorious retro-future, you can hop a rocket to Mars and be there just over a day later... at least if Mars isn't on the far side of the sun; we'll deal with fake orbital calculations in a later post.

## I want My Flying Car!

What future would be complete without flying cars. Since anti-grav is one of the forbidden technologies of the setting, flying cars make due with more prosaic enclosed rotor set-ups and aerodynamic bodies that help provide lift and steering. They are capable of vertical ascent and decent, with speeds more in line with helicopters (70-150 mph) than specialized air vehicles like planes, jets, and shuttle-craft.

A typical flying car will have a range of 8 hours on a standard vehicle battery charge (Type V), although an exploratory vehicle might have heavier-duty batteries, or even an atomic plant. They are not typically pressurized, intended for travel a few hundred feet up, and navigating by sight instead of instruments. They do usually have an auto-pilot, capable of navigating and landing autonomously, and self-piloting air-taxis are frequently employed in cities large enough to make it worthwhile.

## Tech That Doesn't Exist

The following are SF technologies that doesn't exist in the setting, unless introduced by the Referee as part of an adventure 

- FTL travel and communications 
- Time Travel
- Anti-gravity
- Artificial Intelligence (self-aware kind)
- Cloning (at least not that duplicates minds)
- Matter Transmission 
- Portals to other dimensions or universes
- Shrinking or Growth rays

Adventures might be built around the discovery of any or all of these, but they are likely to change the setting significantly if they become widespread.

There is also tech that exists in our world that was never developed or never caught on the the setting:

- Ubiquitous cellular telephones
- The Internet
- DVDs/CD-ROM
- Touch Screens (exist on Terra in consumer goods, but isn't trusted for critical systems or in space)

## Handwavium

On the flip side of forbidden tech is tech that slides into pulp/super-science territory. Chemicals, isotopes, rays, and unknown elements with strange properties are unremarkable parts of Planetary Frontiers. Anything that we really know better now than what seemed plausible or at least vaguely possible back in the day can and should be explained by such quasi-science.

For instance, a sufficiently energetic fuel to allow the kind of full G constant acceleration that ships in PF have isn't really possible, but that won't stop us. Thanks to Chemical X, rocket fuel that fits the bill can be refined and made available nearly everywhere in the solar system. The Miraclo vitamin allows humans to work and live in low gravity without debilitating loss of bone density and muscle mass. Etc.

## Space Suits

Space Suits, or Ships Suits, are garments worn by almost all spacers. They are skin tight to help prevent blood pooling in the extremities in Zero G, and often worn under other clothing for everyday activities. They are resistant to cutting and piercing (Armor 2), and provide insulation against the cold of space, and heat up to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as a small amount of radiation shielding (+2 on saves vs. radiation, flames, or cold). Outer layers providing more, or more specialized, protection against extreme conditions can be added. They are moisture wicking and antibacterial, so you come out of them smelling fresher than when you donned them. 

Adding a bubble helmet makes them into a full-fledged Vacc Suit, with about 1 hour of air with the standard built-in air supply in the collar, or 8 hours or more with an external backpack, depending on the make. The helmet has HUD displays for monitoring vital functions and communications; specialized models may be used for more extended work, including exploration that contain things like water and food-pill dispensers. Civilian models are usually built with more idiot-proof voice and eye-movement tracking controls, while experienced spacers prefer the more robust and resilient mechanical chin controls.

A basic no-frills suit costs 30cr, while the fancier models such as ones that allow the wearer to dial different colors and patterns onto the suit or even make portions transparent can go for 200cr or more.

Passengers and other groundhogs will often go without, relying on emergency dispensers of filmy transparent single-use loose-fitting suits that can go on over their regular clothes; putting them on is like stepping into a large garbage bag with a hood that will seal onto the rest of the suit. These suits are 30cr a dozen, and have 1 hour of air before they need to be hooked to an external source. Passenger ships and life pods have such hookups spaced regularly around the passenger areas. Single suits are not usually rigged in such a way that a standard backpack can be connected (the valve is in front where the wearer can easily hook it up, instead of at the base of the neck where the pack attaches to the collar of the bubble helmet), but could be jury-rigged by an experienced spacer.

## Safe, Cheap, Clean Nuclear Power

Widespread use of a variant of pebble bed reactors that failed safe (increasing reaction produced negative feedback damping the reaction instead of positive feedback leading to a melt-down) caused the proliferation of nuclear reactors and almost completely supplanted petroleum, coal, and other such fuel sources. Rocket ships and most space installations are powered by safe atomic power plants, sometimes supplemented by solar energy either through photovoltaic panels or solar mirror turbines in the inner parts of the solar system where the energy density of sunlight doesn't require impractically large mirrors. The modern version of the portable reactors for civilian vehicles are built with no user-serviceable parts and guaranteed to be proof against crashes, with the worst case scenario the block needing to be decontaminated before being hauled away but negligible damage to the surrounding environment as long as you don't go up and lick it. Even deliberate sabotage would only cause it to stop producing power, but it can't be weaponized short of melting it all and extracting the radioactive materials to use in some other weapon.

Space ship reactors are a bit more complicated, and can be serviced by engineers, because if you're millions of miles from anywhere even a "safe" failure where it's shut down and producing no power is a disaster. Nevertheless the care and feeding of the reactor is one of the more minor duties of the power-deck crew.

## Space Food

For most voyages, the crew consume food capsules (Fud being a popular brand); they contain all the necessary nutrients in a handy pill form, and reduce the amount of solid waste the ship's systems need to process. Passengers will generally eat real food, with quality being commensurate with the price; a luxury liner might offer dining experiences on par with the better restaurants a planet or habitat has to offer.

Most inhabitants of the civilized parts of the system consume only vat-grown meats and hydroponically grown vegetables, if not outright synthetics like food capsules, for practical reasons if nothing else. Eating dead animals or anything that has grown in the dirt is viewed as barbaric, particularly by Terrans.

On colony worlds such as Venus, Ganymede, and to a lesser extent Mars, vegetation is grown through old-fashioned agriculture and the colonists swear that it tastes better and is healthier for you.

Food Capsules cost 15cr for 1 weeks' supply; regular food would cost 5cr per week planet side for what the average person would consume.

Natives generally eat what they have traditionally eaten, whether it's meat from native animals or vegetation. Some more adventurous ones may eat what the humans eat as well, though they scoff at food capsules actually counting as a meal.

Due to either panspermia or interference by the Forerunners, the proteins and micro-organisms of the worlds of the Solar System are largely compatible and no harm will come to the average inhabitant from consuming alien food, though supplements are sometimes advised for long durations without the species' native foods. 

Unfortunately this means that cross-species disease is also possible, though most of the time immune systems are up to it. The exception of course, is the Martian Masterminds, who were nearly wiped out when they brought back the common cold from their second attempt at invading Earth, and there are those who worry that the same thing could happen to other species if they just stumble across the wrong disease.

## Hit Points

You get your die-size in HP modified by your Grit bonus each level. E.g. if you have a d4 as your hit die you get 4 hit points every level, plus any modifiers for Grit. 

Until you reach 0 Hit Points, you're unimpaired. You may be battered, bruised, and bleeding, but your adrenaline, grit and sheer determination keep you going.

When you hit 0, however, you're out of juice and that and every subsequent hit requires that you roll on the Injury Chart below:

| Roll 2d6 | Effect |
|---|---|
| <=2 | Instant Death |
| 3 | Fatal wound (gutted, stabbed through lung, broken back, etc.) Death in 1d4 rounds. Incapacitated. |
| 4 | Severed limb (DM's choice or roll). Incapacitated. |
| 5-6 | Severe Wound. Needs surgery. Incapacitated. |
| 7-8 | Moderate Wound. It's going to need stitches. -2 cumulative to all rolls, including rolls on this table. |
| 9 | Broken bone (DM's choice or roll); Requires 2d4+9 weeks to heal naturally; can't use the bone until that first 2d4 weeks have passed. |
| 10 | Light wound: cut, gash, contusion in random place, and according to weapon type. Needs bandaging. |
| 11 | Knocked out for 2d6 rounds, unless wearing a helmet. With helmet, only stunned for 1 round. |
| >=12 | A surge of adrenaline returns 1d4 hit points; these vanish at the end of combat & you are incapacitated. |

Injury Table

If the wound rolled does not indicate that you're incapacitated, you can keep going but the next thing that hurts you goes directly to this chart with a -2 penalty to everything you attempt (cumulative if you still won't quit). Incapacitated means that you're out of the fight, though if you're not dead you might still be able to talk, albeit painfully. If you take another wound after being incapacitated, you're dead.

## What Are Hit Points?

Hit Points represent your ability to survive in the face of danger and deprivation. Really they could be called Survival Points, but Hit Point is the traditional term. Hit Points represent the hard-to-explain ability of veterans to survive where green n00bs succumb. It's not a measure of physical fitness or athleticism--though those can help--or fresh troops right out of training, well-fed and well-rested, would be the best at it, instead of the worst. What's more, it can be observed in contexts like piloting where it's clearly not a measure of health or physical robustness at all. Rather it's a mental preparedness and toughness, familiarity with various dangers and quickness to react to them in appropriate ways and in some cases sheer cussedness that lets veterans in dangerous circumstances enjoy survival rates many times those of the inexperienced. On the other hand, it's not an innate talent and survivorship bias; rookies eventually become experienced and then veteran without the almost total turnover that would be implied by just filling the ranks until all the survivors are the natural geniuses. It can be learned by doing.

It's not a permanent state of preparedness, though; combat, fatigue, discomfort and deprivation all chip away at it and even veteran troops can't stay fighting forever without a break. Eventually they need to be rotated to less stressful duties and given R&R until they can recover their edge.

In the game, this is abstracted as Hit Points; every time an attack rolls well enough to hurt you or anything else that contributes to significant stress, you won't take a grievous or fatal wound until your HP are reduced to 0. Instead your HP is chipped away. Depending on the nature of the stress you might or might not be taking some physical wound as a result, cuts, bruises, maybe even fractures... but until you're out of Hit Points they're the kind of thing that can be patched up with a spray of dermaplast, a quick bandage, etc. Those patch jobs, though, won't restore your Hit Points. To recover Hit Points requires either medicine, psionics, rest, or in a pinch stimulants that can restore your mental edge.

## Medicine and Healing

## Natural Healing

A full day of rest and relaxation restores 1d3 of Hit Points; you don't have to be absolutely idle, and some light activity such as hiking or sailing can be therapeutic, but not if it's through unknown territory where you might be attacked at any moment. Otherwise a full night's sleep restores 1 Hit Point.

If you've taken any wounds (as a result of reaching 0 Hit Points) you need to heal them first before you can recover any Hit Points. Keep track of the worst (lowest) roll you made on the Injury chart. First, any medical procedure indicated by the Injury chart must be performed on you, and then for each day of complete bed-rest you roll a Death Save and on a success you add one to the rolled number. Once the number is >= 12, you have healed the injuries and can recover Hit Points as normal.

## Broken Bones

Broken bones are special in that as far as wounds go, they only have to be healed up from the number rolled (9) before you can start recovering Hit Points, but they require the listed time (9+2d4 **weeks**) before you can use the limb normally. Trying to use the limb before then suffers a penalty = however many weeks you have remaining to heal.

## Treatment

Injuries require medical treatment as indicated by the Injury chart; anybody with Medical skill can perform the necessary procedures short of surgery, only somebody with Medical skill 1 or higher can perform surgery. An Auto-doc qualifies as having Medical skill 1.

Being under a medic's care in a hospital environment or one with adequate resources allows you to automatically pass the daily save vs. Death required to heal; in more rugged conditions you still have to roll, but can add the Medic's skill +1 as a bonus to the save.

## Advanced Medicine

Nearly any non-fatal injury can be repaired surgically, and most known diseases can be cured with the proper medicines; new diseases picked up during exploration may pose a problem, and not every ship or facility will have the correct medicines for all problems, though most will have a stock capable of treating all the local diseases.

Limbs can be regrown from cloned cells and reattached, though the facilities to do so are only found in major medical centers or advanced military or research stations that expect such injuries. Cybernetic limbs are a rarity for this reason, although temporary prosthetics can usually be fashioned for people who don't have the option of immediate transport to a capable facility.

Birth defects and genetic disorders have been eliminated in all the civilized parts of the system, though there are places on Luna or in the belt where there are communities that refuse to use the necessary screening and treatment.

## Med Pack

Med Packs can restore 1 Hit Die worth of Hit Points for your class; these act as normal Hit Points, and your HP total can't be raised above its normal max. E.g. if your hit die is d6, you get 6 points back.

**Stim Packs** 

Stim Packs can grant 1 Hit Die of Temporary Hit Points, and these *can* temporarily raise your max HP (not more than 1HD worth no matter how many you use) and can be applied to somebody who has hit 0 Hit Points but is not Incapacitated according to the Injury chart. As soon as you sleep, are knocked unconscious, stunned, or hit 0 HP the temporary bonus goes away.

When the bonus goes away you have to make a save vs Death with a penalty equal to the total number of HD you added via Stim Packs; if you fail you are deeply unconscious and cannot be woken safely before you've slept a number of hours equal to the number of Temp HP Added.

If the total roll is <= 0 *or* if you had hit 0 HP before the Stim Pack was applied then you fall into a coma and roll on the Injury table... you don't get the specific injury rolled but you do treat the rolled number as how far you have to heal to regain consciousness.

## Z-Rays

Z-Rays can accelerate the natural process of healing; for each hour in bathed in the purple glow of a Z-Ray chamber a patient will experience 1 day's worth of recovery from injuries. Z-Rays do not restore Hit Points, since the accelerated biological processes don't do anything to relax and restore the mental stability of the patient. Z-Ray patients are usually put under a light hypnosis if they aren't already unconscious during the process so they don't put undue stress on their bodies.

Z-Ray treatment is not effective against diseases, unless the disease could be successfully treated without acceleration. Z-Ray treatment is contra-indicated in the event of parasites, and medics are cautioned to scrutinize for signs before initiating the procedure.

## Skill Packages

Skill Packages are a combination of 5 skills or skill advancements that represent typical training for somebody in that occupation. Typically they are chosen at character creation and further skills are gained through level advancement; it may be possible to acquire skill packages through taking time off in game to train, at the Referee's discretion, though it would usually involve joining an organization that would put you through the necessary months or even years of training. During this time the character wouldn't be available to adventure.

## Paper

Believe it or not, paper still exists and is a major if not primary form of information storage, although it's usually synthetic materials and not pulped wood. Whatever you might say about storage capacity and searchability of computer records, whether magnetic, holographic, or laser-etched storage, space travelers need a medium that can't be disrupted by loss of power or erased by magnetic storms.

Ships charts and reference materials, and log books are still literally books, while stuff that exists purely for entertainment purposes is more likely to be recordings.

## Languages

Esperanto is the universal language of the spaceways, and the official language of Terra, Luna and the L5 habitats. Other languages exist alongside Esperanto, even on Terra, but all official signage and all labels on equipment used in space as well as all traffic control use it.

There are communities that reject its use internally, but nearly anyone that's not a barbarian can speak it. 

The language skill represents fluency in a language other than Esperanto and whatever your native language might be (player's choice). Each point is another language instead of increasing fluency.

Languages can also be learned temporarily by hypno tapes; you can have as many of these simultaneously as your Psi bonus, and you can overwrite one with another, no harm done. It takes a week of sleep learning to absorb on language this way. The cost of a language tape is 500cr.

## Interplanetary Crimes

Since there is no overall governing polity of the Solar System, interplanetary crimes like international crimes of pre-space Earth, are only the crimes that the diverse governing bodies can mutually agree upon.

- Murder
- Piracy
- Kidnapping
- Slavery
- Grand Theft (excess of 1k cr)
- Grand Fraud (excess of 1k cr)
- Creating a Navigational Hazard
- Endangerment of a Habitat or Spacecraft
- Interference with a Protected Sapient Species

Smuggling is not a crime, or at least is not something that the Space Patrol gets involved in enforcing, since the list of what's contraband varies too much from habitat to habitat and is in constant flux; local authorities are expected to enforce their own rules on arrival.

The jurisdiction of the Space Patrol is technically the entire Solar System, including the orbital space around the planets, but not the planetary surfaces themselves. There is a hot-pursuit exception to discourage criminals from recklessly racing towards a planet or habitat to thwart an arrest.

![](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/patrolwomanfindingtrouble.jpg?w=500)

## Interplanetary Punishment

In civilized areas, the punishment for crimes is psychiatric counseling, usually assisted by a trained Esper licensed by the Rhine Institute, which cures the convict's criminal tendencies. Former criminals are then naturally compelled by their consciences to make full restitution to their victims and their families, or where that is not possible make a good faith effort to somehow make up for their heinous actions.

Terra will often nonetheless exile reformed criminals, on the grounds that even their adjusted psych profiles fall outside the parameters required for citizenship.

Less civilized areas may just make convicted criminals breath space or be sacrificed to the volcano gods. Some rougher places in the Belt may not bother with the formality of conviction.

## Planetary Overland Travel

The following is for hiking around the unexplored areas of the various planets in the Solar System, ignoring vehicular travel and settled areas for now.

## Marching

Baseline March distances, assuming perfectly level ground or roads with no environmental hazards, and that marching is inversely proportional to the local gravity (that is, you can "march" on the moon taking huge bounds).

1. Mercury: 52 km
2. Venus: 34 km
3. Earth: 32 km (reference)
4. Moon: 80 km
5. Mars: 52 km

The following chart assumes that you normalize the size of the hex so that a person with medium encumbrance can travel approximately 3 such hexes in a day's travel.

![](https://planetaryfrontiers.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nmile_hexes.png?w=800)

This means that the size of the hexes are approximate

1. Mercury: 17 km
2. Venus: 11 km
3. Earth: 11 km
4. Moon: 27 km
5. Mars: 17 km

These sizes are chosen purely for convenience when calculating travel distances on foot

## Distance to the Horizon

Approximate distance to the horizon at "sea-level" for somebody 2 meters tall (sqrt(2Rh))

rounded to the nearest km

1. Mercury: 3 km
2. Venus: 4 km
3. Earth: 5 km
4. Moon: 2 km
5. Mars: 3 km

The implication of this is that on most planets, even given a completely unobstructed view the characters will not be able to see to the edge of the hex they are in without gaining some altitude.

## Wilderness Exploration

Here's the procedure for traveling across the wilderness on an untamed planet. The Ref rolls secretly one d6 per day, at the beginning of the day. The event (if any) happens in the first hex you enter that where the total travel cost >= the number rolled, or any hex thereafter at the Ref's discretion if too many seem to be happening right at the start of the day. If the party stops traveling for the day before the event comes up then it happens overnight.

## Events

1. Encounter
2. Environmental/Potential Encounter
3. Exhaustion/Potential Encounter
4. Clue
5. Consume Resources
6. Setback

If the roll is Potential Encounter, it becomes an encounter if the cost to enter the hex is >= to the roll; thus more rugged terrain increases the chance of an encounter with an alien life-form. This doesn't necessarily mean the more rugged terrain is more densely populated (though that's certainly true of the steaming jungles of Venus); it could be that in more resource poor areas the predators are more likely to be stalking you or in particularly rugged terrain everyone sticks to the easy-to-traverse paths.

On lifeless worlds, Encounter becomes Setback, and Setback becomes encounter with other travelers.

**Encounter:** Encounter some potential hostiles.  See below.

**Potential Encounter:** Encounter some potential hostiles if the terrain cost is greater than or equal to the die roll. That is, if the hex costs 2 to enter then a 2 is an encounter but a 3 isn't; if the terrain costs 3 to enter then a 2 or 3 is an encounter.  This is cumulative with any other results on the table: a 3 in a mountain hex means an encounter **and** Exhaustion.

**Environmental:** Non-combat event specific to the particular environment. This can include encounters that are unlikely to be hostile even if they get a poor reaction, such as native inhabitants, local settlers, game animals, and so on.

**Exhaustion:** Take a short rest (1-hour) or suffer 1d4 Hit Point damage from fatigue.

**Clue:** Gain some information about something: evidence of nearby creatures, settlements, alien ruins,
