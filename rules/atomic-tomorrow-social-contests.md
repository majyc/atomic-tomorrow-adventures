# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES

## SOCIAL CONTESTS

In the retro-future world of Atomic Tomorrow, fast talking, seduction, and persuasion are skills as valuable as marksmanship or piloting. This system provides guidelines for handling social interactions as meaningful contests without undermining player agency.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Social Skills Are Not Mind Control**: Even critical successes cannot force others to act against their core values or self-interest
2. **Preserve Agency**: Player characters always retain the right to determine their own actions
3. **Reward Roleplay**: Going along with social influence (even when disadvantageous) enriches the story
4. **Consequences Matter**: Social skills create believable reactions based on the context and relationship

## TYPES OF SOCIAL CONTESTS

### Persuasion

*Convincing someone that a course of action is logical, moral, or beneficial*

- Uses CHARM vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes you are sincere and your argument has merit
- Doesn't override strong ethical objections or survival instincts

### Deception

*Convincing someone to believe something that isn't true*

- Uses GUILE vs. GUILE
- Success means the target believes your falsehood
- Extreme claims still receive appropriate skepticism even on success

### Intimidation

*Frightening someone into compliance*

- Uses BRAWN (physical) or NERVE (psychological) vs. GRIT
- Success means the target feels genuinely threatened
- Temporary compliance only; may create resentment and future retaliation

### Seduction

*Appealing to someone's attraction or desire*

- Uses CHARM vs. CHARM
- Success means the target finds you genuinely appealing
- Doesn't override professional ethics, loyalty, or self-preservation

## DETERMINING OUTCOMES

## THE CONVICTION TRACK

| Level | State     | Description                 |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 1     | Convinced | Fully accepts the position  |
| 2     | Receptive | Inclined to agree           |
| 3     | Neutral   | Undecided, weighing options |
| 4     | Skeptical | Doubtful but listening      |
| 5     | Opposed   | Firmly against the position |

## STARTING POSITION

NPCs begin at different positions based on their initial attitude and the request's nature:

* **Friendly/Reasonable Request** : Start at 2 (Receptive)
* **Neutral/Moderate Request** : Start at 3 (Neutral)
* **Unfriendly/Unreasonable Request** : Start at 4 (Skeptical)
* **Hostile/Outrageous Request** : Start at 5 (Opposed)

## SYMMETRICAL SUCCESS/FAILURE EFFECTS

When attempting social influence:

1. Make an opposed roll using the appropriate social skill against their resistance
2. Movement on the Conviction Track is symmetrical:
   * **Critical Success** : Move 3 steps toward Convinced
   * **Special Success** : Move 2 steps toward Convinced
   * **Regular Success** : Move 1 step toward Convinced
   * **Regular Failure** : Move 1 step toward Opposed
   * **Special Failure** : Move 2 steps toward Opposed
   * **Critical Failure** : Move 3 steps toward Opposed

## PLAYER CHARACTER TARGETS

When NPCs attempt to influence player characters:

1. The GM rolls the NPC's social skill against the player's resistance attribute
2. The GM reports the success quality and current position on the Conviction Track
3. The player decides how their character responds, guided by the Conviction Track
4. **Experience Reward** : When a player goes along with social influence that leads to suboptimal choices based on the Conviction Track, they automatically receive a skill advancement check for that adventure

This creates a rewarding gameplay loop where players gain mechanical benefits when they embrace roleplaying over pure tactical advantage.

## INTERACTION LIMITS

To prevent endless attempts:

* Each social interaction scene allows a maximum of 3 influence attempts
* After the third attempt, the target's position becomes fixed until circumstances significantly change
* Each subsequent attempt within a scene incurs a cumulative -20% penalty

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

 **Player** : "I need to convince this security officer to let me into the restricted zone."

 **GM** : "This is an unfriendly context with an unreasonable request, so he starts at position 4 (Skeptical)."

 **Player** : "I'll flash my Atomic Energy Commission credentials and explain the urgency of my inspection."

*Player rolls 76 on Persuasion (65%) - a failure*
*Security officer rolls 43 on SAVVY (55%) - a success*

 **GM** : "Your failure against his success moves his position 1 step from Skeptical (4) to Opposed (5). He looks at your credentials suspiciously and says, 'These don't authorize access to this section. You'll need proper clearance from the director.'"

 **Player** : "I'll try a different approach. I'll use my Deception skill to imply I'm working directly with the facility director."

*Player rolls 22 on Deception (70%) - a critical success*
*Security officer rolls 67 on SAVVY (55%) - a failure*

 **GM** : "Your critical success against his failure moves his position 3 steps from Opposed (5) to Neutral (3). He hesitates, then says, 'The director didn't notify me, but things have been chaotic today. I can let you in for a quick inspection, but stay with me at all times.'"

### PLAYER AS TARGET EXAMPLE

 **GM** : "The mysterious woman in the red dress approaches your table. 'I couldn't help noticing your ship in the docking bay,' she says with a hint of a Venusian accent. 'I'd be willing to pay handsomely for a... discreet transport of certain items to Europa. No questions asked.' She's attempting to persuade you to smuggle contraband."

*GM rolls 15 on her Persuasion (70%) - a special success*
*Player's character has SAVVY 60%, rolls 82 - a failure*

 **GM** : "Her special success against your failure moves your Conviction position 2 steps from Neutral (3) to Receptive (2). The offer is temptingâ€”the credits would cover your ship payments for months, and her charm is compelling. Your character feels genuinely inclined to accept the job."

 **Player** : "Even though I know it's risky, I'll go with my character's inclination and accept the job. After all, we need the money, and she seems trustworthy enough."

 **GM** : "Since you're playing along with the social influence despite the potential danger, mark your Deception skill for an advancement check at the end of this adventure."

This approach creates meaningful social interactions while rewarding players for embracing dramatic turns in the story!

## EXPERIENCE REWARD

*"Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment."*

When a player goes along with a successful social attempt that leads their character to make suboptimal choices:

- The character automatically receives a skill advancement check for that adventure
- This represents learning from mistakes and developing better judgment
- The advancement works according to the standard skill advancement rules

This reward applies when:

- The character takes actions they wouldn't normally take
- These actions create additional complications or challenges
- The player embraces these complications for storytelling purposes

## SOCIAL CONTESTS BETWEEN PLAYERS

When one player character attempts to influence another:

1. The initiating player rolls their relevant social skill
2. The target player rolls their relevant resistance attribute
3. The GM describes the quality of the attempt
4. **The target player decides their own response**
5. If they choose to go along with something disadvantageous to them, they receive the experience reward

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Social contests are heavily influenced by context:

### Favorable Circumstances (+20%)

- Using leverage the target cares about
- Offering something the target genuinely needs
- Having reputation or credentials relevant to the request
- Previous positive relationship with the target

### Unfavorable Circumstances (-20%)

- Target has prior negative experience with you
- Request clearly conflicts with target's interests
- Significant status difference (when attempting to influence superiors)
- Target is suspicious or on guard

## LONG-TERM INFLUENCE

Social contests aren't just for immediate results. Successful social interactions can:

1. **Build Reputation**: Making honest persuasion attempts builds credibility for future interactions
2. **Create Relationships**: Successful social contests can begin long-term connections with NPCs
3. **Establish Patterns**: Regularly deceiving someone eventually leads to suspicion
4. **Yield Information**: Even failed attempts can reveal what someone values or fears

## FINAL NOTE

In Atomic Tomorrow Adventures, social skills represent genuine expertise in understanding and influencing people. They're as valuable as technical skills in many situations, but they're not supernatural abilities. The best outcomes come when players embrace both the successes and failures of social contests as opportunities for character development and storytelling.
