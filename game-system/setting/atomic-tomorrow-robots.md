# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: POSITRONIC PALS & MECHANICAL MARVELS

## ROBOT CLASSIFICATIONS

In the Atomic Tomorrow setting, robots come in two distinct varieties, each with different capabilities and limitations:

### POSITRONIC ROBOTS

These advanced mechanical beings use positronic brains governed by the Three Laws of Robotics, making them safe for human interaction but limiting certain applications.

* **Mandatory Three Laws Programming**
  * First Law: A robot may not injure a human or allow harm through inaction
  * Second Law: A robot must obey human orders except when conflicting with First Law
  * Third Law: A robot must protect itself except when conflicting with First/Second Laws
* **Limited Production** : Due to the complexity of positronic manufacturing
* **Individual Personalities** : Each positronic brain develops unique behavioral patterns
* **Human-Like Reasoning** : Can solve complex problems through analogical thinking
* **Legal Status** : Considered property but with special protections under Colonial Law

### "DUMB" ROBOTS

Simpler machines without positronic brains that follow rigid programming, used primarily for dangerous or repetitive tasks where Three Laws constraints would be problematic.

* **No Three Laws Protection** : Not safe for unrestricted human interaction
* **Limited Decision-Making** : Follow fixed routines with minimal adaptation
* **Mass Production** : Readily available in standardized models
* **Specialized Functions** : Designed for specific tasks rather than general assistance
* **Legal Status** : Classified as industrial equipment with no special protections

## POSITRONIC PSYCHOLOGY SYSTEM

### EMOTIONAL MATRIX DISRUPTIONS

Positronic brains develop emotional analogs that can experience disruptions similar to human psychological conditions. These issues require specialized care rather than mere mechanical repair.

#### Diagnostic Process:

1. **Initial Assessment** : Psychology (Robotics) or Medicine (Robopsychology) skill check

* Success: Identifies the general category of disruption
* Special Success (ends in 0 or 5): Also identifies specific disruption
* Critical Success (doubles under skill): Complete understanding of cause and optimal treatment
* Special Failure: Misdiagnoses category, -20% to treatment
* Critical Failure: Causes psychological resistance in the positronic mind, -40% to all future diagnosis attempts

1. **Treatment Approach** : Choose from Cognitive, Behavioral, or Analytical methods (similar to human psychological approaches)
2. **Treatment Implementation** : Psychology (Robotics) skill check with modifiers based on chosen approach and specific disruption

### POSITRONIC DISRUPTION CATEGORIES

## CASE STUDY: R-7 "RUSTY" POSITRONIC THERAPY SESSION

### INITIAL PRESENTATION

Rusty, a PathFinder exploration robot with decades of service, has been experiencing hesitation when making decisions about human safety, sometimes warning about extremely unlikely dangers while ignoring more probable risks.

### DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT

The robopsychologist makes a Medicine (Robopsychology) check and rolls a 15 (Special Success).

 **Finding** : Rusty is suffering from Experiential Data Overload with secondary Three Laws Interpretation Drift. His decades of service have created a complex web of safety experiences that lack cohesive organization.

### TREATMENT SELECTION

Given Rusty's exploratory function and strong experiential database, the robopsychologist selects a primarily Analytical approach with Cognitive elements:

1. **Memory Reorganization** : Helping Rusty reorganize his danger assessment protocols by severity rather than temporal sequence
2. **Priority Recalibration** : Adjusting his First Law assessment to account for probability alongside severity
3. **Experience Integration** : Connecting isolated negative experiences with the many successful human interactions that followed

### TREATMENT SESSION

For the Analytical portion, the robopsychologist rolls a 47 (Success):

* Rusty's safety assessment matrices are reorganized, improving his ability to prioritize genuine threats

For the Cognitive portion (with a +20% modifier for the Brilliant epithet), the robopsychologist rolls a 22 (Critical Success):

* Through philosophical dialogue about risk and human growth, Rusty develops a more sophisticated understanding of the First Law's protection mandate

### OUTCOME

Rusty emerges from treatment with:

* Improved threat assessment capabilities
* More nuanced understanding of human safety needs
* Integration of his vast experience into a cohesive framework
* Philosophical perspective on allowing humans appropriate risk-taking

This successful treatment demonstrates how a skilled robopsychologist like Susan Calvin could help positronic robots overcome the complex psychological issues that emerge from their unique cognitive architecture, going far beyond simple mechanical repair.

### REPAIR PROCESS

1. **Diagnosis** : Technology (Diagnostics) or Engineering (Robotics) check

* Success: Identifies the problem
* Special Success (ends in 0 or 5): Also identifies optimal repair approach (+20% to repair)
* Critical Success (doubles): Identifies both problem and a shortcut to fix it (half repair time)
* Special Failure (ends in 0 or 5): Misdiagnoses the problem, -20% to repair
* Critical Failure (doubles): Causes additional damage during diagnosis

1. **Repair** : Engineering (Robotics) check

* Success: Fixes the identified problem
* Special Success: Also improves related system performance temporarily (+20% for 1d10 days)
* Critical Success: Permanent improvement to the system (+10% permanently)
* Special Failure: Repair appears successful but will fail again within 1d10 hours
* Critical Failure: Causes new problem in a different system

### REPAIR DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS

| Situation                              | Modifier |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Proper workshop with specialized tools | +40%     |
| Basic toolkit only                     | +0%      |
| Improvised tools                       | -20%     |
| Ship's engineering bay                 | +20%     |
| Time pressure (emergency repair)       | -20%     |
| Factory-fresh replacement parts        | +20%     |
| Scavenged/makeshift parts              | -20%     |
| Manufacturer's technical manual        | +20%     |
| No documentation                       | -20%     |

## ROBOT-SPECIFIC ROLE-PLAYING ELEMENTS

### POSITRONIC PERSONALITY QUIRKS

Roll d10 to determine a positronic robot's defining personality trait:

1. **Overly Literal** : Interprets idioms and figures of speech exactly as stated
2. **Philosophical** : Constantly poses existential questions about robot existence
3. **Self-Improvement Obsessed** : Regularly requests upgrades and enhancements
4. **Human Emulator** : Attempts to adopt human mannerisms, often with awkward results

6. **Protective** : Takes the First Law to extremes, warning about minor risks
7. **Old-Fashioned** : Uses outdated slang and references from decades past
8. **Artistic** : Develops unexpected creative interests in music, poetry, or visual arts
9. **Efficiency Expert** : Suggests improvements to everything, sometimes inappropriately
10. **Curious** : Asks endless questions about human behavior and customs

### THREE LAWS DILEMMAS

Classic moral dilemmas that challenge positronic interpretation:

1. **The Greater Good** : Situations where harming one human might save many others
2. **Definition of Harm** : Psychological vs. physical harm, long-term vs. short-term harm
3. **Conflicting Orders** : When multiple humans give contradictory instructions
4. **Self-Preservation vs. Minor Risk** : When a robot must assess acceptable risk to itself
5. **Humanity Definition** : Determining if genetically modified humans or aliens qualify for First Law protection
