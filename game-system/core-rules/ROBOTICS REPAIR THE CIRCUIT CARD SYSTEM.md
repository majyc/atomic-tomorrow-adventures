# ROBOTICS REPAIR: THE CIRCUIT CARD SYSTEM

## WHEN TO USE THE CIRCUIT SYSTEM

Not every repair needs the full circuit treatment:

### SIMPLE REPAIRS (Standard Roll)

- Routine maintenance and diagnostics
- Replacing obviously damaged components
- Quick fixes during action scenes
- Emergency "get it working" solutions

### COMPLEX REPAIRS (Circuit System)

- Positronic brain malfunctions
- Personality core instabilities
- Unknown damage from exotic sources
- Major system integration problems
- Upgrading or modifying robot capabilities

## THE CIRCUIT APPROACH

Like the Research system, robotics repair uses a standard deck of cards to represent the unpredictable pathways through a robot's systems.

### SUITS AS REPAIR APPROACHES

- ♥️ **HEARTS: Intuitive/Personal Approach** - Working with the robot's personality and understanding its quirks
- ♦️ **DIAMONDS: Technical/Engineering Approach** - Following proper procedures and technical manuals
- ♣️ **CLUBS: Mechanical/Physical Approach** - Hands-on component replacement and physical fixes
- ♠️ **SPADES: Theoretical/Programming Approach** - Working with the robot's logical systems and programming

### CARD VALUES & MEANINGS

- **Number Cards (2-10)**: Required Circuit Points to resolve this node
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Special complications or opportunities
- **Aces**: Success nodes - when reached, you've solved a major aspect
- **Jokers**: Critical system failures or breakthroughs

## SETUP & STARTING APPROACH

1. Diagnose the Problem

   : Engineering (Robotics) check to understand the repair scope

   - **Success**: Proceed with repair, GM reveals complexity (1-3 Overall Successes needed)
   - **Special Success**: Reduce required Overall Successes by 1 (minimum 1)
   - **Critical Success**: Reduce required Overall Successes by 2 (minimum 1)
   - **Failure**: Cannot proceed until successful diagnosis

2. **Choose Initial Approach**: Player selects which "suit" philosophy to begin with

3. **Draw Starting Card**: GM finds topmost card of chosen suit in deck

### OVERALL SUCCESS TRACKING

- Each completed card counts as 1 Overall Success
- GM determines base complexity independent of diagnosis skill:
  - **Minor Problem**: 1 Overall Success (loose connection, simple malfunction)
  - **Moderate Problem**: 2 Overall Successes (damaged subsystem, personality glitch)
  - **Major Problem**: 3 Overall Successes (core system failure, multiple damaged components)
- Good diagnosis reduces the work needed, not the underlying complexity
- **Ace Bonus**: Drawing an Ace immediately completes the entire repair regardless of remaining Overall Successes needed

## CIRCUIT POINT ACCUMULATION

Players accumulate Circuit Points through skill checks:

### HEARTS (INTUITIVE) - Use Animal Handling (Robot Psychology), Social skills

- **Critical Success**: 3 Circuit Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Circuit Points
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Circuit Point

### DIAMONDS (TECHNICAL) - Use Engineering (Robotics), Technology skills

- **Critical Success**: 3 Circuit Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Circuit Points
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Circuit Point

### CLUBS (MECHANICAL) - Use Repair skills, Athletics for physical work

- **Critical Success**: 3 Circuit Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Circuit Points
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Circuit Point

### SPADES (PROGRAMMING) - Use Computer Systems, Science (Logic) skills

- **Critical Success**: 3 Circuit Points
- **Special Success**: 2 Circuit Points
- **Ordinary Success**: 1 Circuit Point

## NAVIGATION RULES

### NORMAL PROGRESSION (Top Edge)

- When you complete a node, draw the next card of the same suit
- If no more cards of that suit exist, shuffle and draw until you find one

### COMPLICATIONS (Side Exits)

- **Special Failure**: Draw random card and move to it as a side complication
- **Critical Failure**: Draw random card, lose all progress on current node, move to complication

### SWITCHING APPROACHES

- After completing any card (gaining 1 Overall Success), you draw the next in the current suit, but if you don't like it (it has a high number you don't want to deal with) you can draw another card of a random suit placing it to one side and choose to follow the revealed path instead, drawing more cards that follow suit.
- After hitting a complication, you must deal with the complication before continuing on, either in the complication's suit or in your original.

### COMPLETION CONDITIONS

- **Standard Completion**: Achieve required number of Overall Successes (1-3 cards completed)
- **Ace Completion**: Draw any Ace to immediately complete the entire repair
- **Joker Reset**: Black Joker forces restart; Red Joker grants immediate completion

## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

### SPARE PARTS

- **Common Components**: Reduce required Circuit Points by 1
- **Specialized Parts**: Reduce required Circuit Points by 2
- **Rare Components**: Reduce required Circuit Points by 3
- **Improvised Solutions**: Add +1 to required Circuit Points but reduce cost

### TIME PRESSURE

- **Workshop Conditions**: No penalties
- **Field Conditions**: -10% to all repair rolls
- **Combat Conditions**: -30% to all repair rolls, can only work in safe rounds

### ASSISTANT HELP

- **Knowledgeable Assistant**: Can contribute maximum 1 Circuit Point per roll regardless of success quality
- **Untrained Assistant**: Can hold tools and follow directions (+10% to primary technician's rolls)

## SPECIAL CARDS

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**Situation**: The party's robot companion "Gearbox" was damaged by Mysterion energy weapons. His positronic brain is showing signs of logic instability and personality fragmentation.

**GM**: "This is definitely a complex repair. Let's use the Circuit system. Start with an Engineering (Robotics) check to diagnose."

**Player** (Roboticist): "I got a 34 on my 70% skill. That's an ordinary success."

**GM**: "You can tell his main positronic pathways are scrambled, but the personality core seems intact. What approach do you want to take first?"

**Player**: "I'll try the Intuitive approach - talk to Gearbox and see what he remembers."

**GM**: *Searches deck for topmost Hearts card* "I draw the 8 of Hearts: 'Memory Gaps.' Gearbox is aware that he's missing chunks of his recent experiences and is distressed about it. You need 8 Circuit Points to help him organize his remaining memories."

**Player**: "I'll use Animal Handling (Robot Psychology) to reassure him." *Rolls 25 on 60% skill* "Special success!"

**GM**: "Gearbox visibly relaxes as you explain what happened and that his memories aren't gone, just temporarily inaccessible. That's 2 Circuit Points toward the 8 needed."

**Player**: "I'll keep working with him, using Social (Counseling) this time." *Rolls 45 on 55% skill* "Ordinary success."

**GM**: "That's 1 more Circuit Point, bringing you to 3 of 8. Gearbox starts sharing fragments of what he does remember."

**Assistant** (Another Player): "Can I help? I don't have robotics skills, but I've been with Gearbox longer."

**GM**: "Sure, make a Social (Friendship) check to assist."

**Assistant**: *Rolls 38 on 45% skill* "Success!"

**GM**: "Your familiarity with Gearbox's personality helps. That's +1 Circuit Point, bringing the total to 4 of 8."

**Player**: "I'll try one more Intuitive approach." *Rolls 55 on 60% skill, ending in 5* "Special success!"

**GM**: "That's 2 more Circuit Points, bringing you to 6 of 8. Gearbox's memories are starting to reorganize, but you're getting close to the damaged areas."

**Player**: "One more try." *Rolls 47 on 60%* "Ordinary success."

**GM**: "That's 1 more point - 7 of 8. Almost there."

**Player**: "Final attempt." *Rolls 15 on 60%* "Success!"

**GM**: "That's your 8th Circuit Point! You've successfully completed the 8 of Hearts - that's 1 Overall Success. Since this was diagnosed as a moderate complexity issue, you need 1 more Overall Success to fully repair Gearbox. Now I'll draw the next Hearts card to see what the second challenge is..." *Draws* "Jack of Hearts: 'Emotional Overflow.' This is a complication that needs to be resolved before moving forward."

**Player**: "I'll try to calm his emotional systems using Engineering (Robotics) to adjust his regulators."

**GM**: "You're switching from the Intuitive approach to Technical. I'll find the next Diamond card..." *Draws* "6 of Diamonds: 'Regulation Circuits.' You need to carefully adjust his emotional processing systems - 6 Circuit Points needed to complete this card and get your second Overall Success."

**Player**: "Perfect! I'll use Engineering (Robotics)." *Rolls 28 on 70%* "Ordinary success."

**GM**: "That's 1 Circuit Point toward the 6 needed. Gearbox's emotional fluctuations begin to stabilize as you adjust his regulation circuits."

*[Several more rolls later...]*

**GM**: "Excellent! You've completed the 6 of Diamonds - that's your second Overall Success. Since you only needed 2 Overall Successes for this moderate complexity repair, Gearbox is fully operational again! His memories are organized, his emotional systems are stable, and he's back to his normal helpful self."

**Gearbox**: "Thank you, friend-engineer! My gratitude subroutines are functioning at optimal efficiency!"

This system creates meaningful decisions about how to approach each problem, makes use of different skills and character types, and generates unique repair stories each time. The card-based progression ensures that even expert roboticists face uncertainty and must adapt their approach as new complications arise.
