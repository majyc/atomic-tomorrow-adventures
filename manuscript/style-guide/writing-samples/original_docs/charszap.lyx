Before you begin
\shape default
 the GM or entire group decides certain aspects of the campaign, such as
 Scope, basic setting, Tone, and campaign goals before character creation.
 For example, the campaign could be light-hearted and set in a Space Cadet
 Academy, with most characters being Academy students, a serious relatively
 hard SF campaign about the crew of a interstellar scout ship seeking out
 new worlds and new civilizations, a grim post-apocalyptic setting where
 the characters are survivors of a devastating biological war, or even a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space opera
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 western-in-space.
 This campaign information affects character creation in informal ways,
 such as deciding that a hard bitten space bounty hunter or a member of
 a semi-mystical order of Star Knights is an appropriate character concept.
 There are also two mechanical ways the campaign's design affects player
 character creation.
 First, the Scope of the campaign will determine the personal power level
 of the characters, at least at the beginning.
 Secondly, the GM will decide on or create templates for standard creature
 types available as player characters.
 For example, templates for particular alien races means aliens PCs and
 NPCs will be relatively common, and specifies what exactly is true of those
 aliens in the game.

\begin_layout Section
Before You Begin: Scope and Tone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you actually start creating characters, you need to make some decisions
 about the kind of science fiction game you want to play.
 The GM and the players should collectively decide on the Scope for the
 adventures, and the Tone that the game will take.
 Is the group going to be a rag-tag bunch of survivors of an apocalypse
 trying to hang on one more day, the crew of a starship trying to eke a
 living on the frontier or carry out missions assigned by Star Command,
 guardians of an entire galaxy fighting a war against extra-galactic invaders,
 or something else? Will the players be average Joes with some specialized
 training and gear, elite commandos with state-of-the-art equipment, futuristic
 supermen and women with psionic or technological powers that grant them
 godlike abilities? Is death and dying something that rarely happens to
 PCs, and can usually be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 with appropriate technology, or will it be a minor triumph if the PCs survive
 an adventure, or somewhere in between?

\begin_layout Section
Adventure Scope and Personal Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Scope"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scope describes how large an area the characters' typical adventures take
 place in and how powerful they are individually.
 The Adventure Scope refers to the size of the area they typically travel
 within and is usually tied to their available means of transportation;
 the Personal Scope refers to how much ability the individual characters
 have to affect the outcomes of things within the area of the adventure.
 The two are related, but not identical.
 For instance, it is common in science fiction to have adventures take the
 heroes from star system to star system, while the heroes themselves are
 little more than average Joes and Janes who might find themselves mugged
 in a back-alley of some starport if they're not careful; on the flip side,
 you have stories like some Roger Zelazny novels such as 
\emph on
Lord of Light 
\emph default
where the characters are literally godlike in power but the entire action
 of the story is confined to one world.
 While campaigns may eventually transcend the original Scopes, you should
 pick a Personal Scope at the start that will be satisfactory to play for
 quite some time.
 Most of the time in science fiction, characters who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

level up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and significantly change their Personal Scope either do so at the start,
 and that's what kicks off their adventures, or gain great power at the
 end and use it to resolve things...it's relatively unusual to have a sequels
 at the new level of power remain as interesting.
 Groups that want to try different power levels as a change of pace might
 consider creating new characters in the same setting but at the desired
 Scope, and returning to the lower-powered characters when they feel like
 more down-to-Earth adventures, rather than ramping up the original characters
 with newly discovered powers, symbiotic alien tech, and the like.
 On the other hand, Adventure Scopes regularly increase over the course
 of science fiction stories, as the characters find themselves visiting
 far-flung places and interacting with larger and larger areas of the setting.
 Note that many famous SF characters, even ones who regularly win fights,
 would only count as Scope 1 Normals.
 If you can imagine the character actually needing to surrender or flee
 when confronted with a fire-team of four soldiers with rifles leveled,
 that character is probably Scope 1.
 Note also that characters may be in command of ships or organizations well
 above their own in Scope.
 The same shoulder-rolling starship Captain that finds it wise to surrender
 to a fire team of four soldiers may command a vessel that could fight an
 entire army, or even planet, on equal terms.

 You are part of a large group that provides support, missions, and transportati
on.
 While you rarely make a crucial difference individually, your group works
 for larger aims.
 Organizations can themselves vary in Scope and power-level, but most of
 their operatives will still be at the agent power-level, whether they are
 the local police department or a world-conquering conspiracy.
 The differences will be in the number of agents, the equipment provided
 to the agents, and the number and level of higher-powered officers and
 specialists that work alongside them.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tone is probably the single most important decision about your campaign.
 Tone is about the way the game feels, the mood and the atmosphere of the
 adventures.
 You can and should vary the tone somewhat from session to session, and
 within a session, but there will be a prevailing mood to the game.
 SF adventure ranges from Flash Gordon to Firefly to Alien, from Lost in
 Space through Star Trek to the rebooted Battlestar: Galactica.
 This tone will actually influence game play.
 The lighter the tone, the less plausible justifications for SF abilities
 have to be, and the freakier coincidences can be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern SF can also touch on sensitive subjects: sex, violence, and religion.
 There's no right or wrong answer, but a clash of expectations can lead
 to incoherence between the tone the GM is trying to set and what actually
 happens, or players being out of sync with the others.
 It can even lead to players finding the game unpleasant, disturbing, or
 disgusting (or in the other direction, too silly, angsty or sentimental
 to stomach).
 Make sure everybody playing is on basically the same page, and give notice
 in advance if there will be possibly disturbing elements.
 Disagreements over the tone of the campaign can wreck it; when one player
 is aiming for goofy Saturday-morning cartoon style with a post-apocalyptic
 barbarian armed with a laser sword in a world of savagery, super-science
 and sorcery, and another wants to play an ordinary crew member aboard a
 space-going refinery trying eke out a living, something's got to give.
 Even if the players are nominally on the same page with the style of character,
 the Primary Rule of having to make sure that your actions sound like a
 science fiction story places emphasis on having at least rough agreement
 as to what kind of story people have in mind.
 If one player is trying to stick to real-world science as much as possible
 while another takes his cue from the most over-the-top Japanese anime the
 result won't tend to feel like either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One useful way to approach this is to describe your game as similar to a
 source that all the players are familiar with, e.g., is it more like Firefly,
 Robert Heinlein novels, Warhammer 40K, or StarWars? That doesn't have to
 mean it's set in those settings, but it does set the expectations for things
 like levels of violence, humor, plausibility of physical stunts, just how
 cosmic or contrived are technological devices and super-science abilities,
 and so forth.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zap! has no hard-and-fast rules for characters meeting accidental deaths
 in combat.
 This shouldn't stop you from making the game as deadly as you and the players
 want it to be.
 Given sufficient science fictional hand-waving, characters can be repaired
 by advanced medical tech or restored from backup, be revived as cyborgs
 or AI simulations in android bodies, be replaced by a clone or parallel
 universe twin.
 Player characters should really only die permanently when the players want
 them to, but that doesn't mean they don't have a lot at stake.
 Lethality among minor characters is a matter of tone.
 Out can be narrated as dead for minions or bystanders, or you can have
 even Overkilled NPCs make it out alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tone of the campaign might mean that you do brutal things to player
 characters.
 But even in games that are maximally edgy and morbid, players should have
 long-term control over their characters paths.
 You should never force a player to run a character that is warped beyond
 recognition from their original concept.
 If they are not done having fun with the character, find a plot device
 to allow them to revert back.
 Sometimes a PC will need to be retired and run as an NPC, letting the player
 start afresh.

 Pick a concept for your character.
 Captain of a scout ship? Xenobiologist studying alien creatures? Alien
 creature? Interstellar bounty hunter? This is the most important step,
 and one where you might want to consult the other players and the GM, so
 players are matching in tone and consistent with the setting.

Fill in a Template

.
 Templates in Zap! reflect the character's role in the game, as well as
 their abilities.
 So your concept should pretty much determine which template to use: crew
 (few amazing combat powers, but extraordinarily skillful and brave), bad-ass
 (trained combatant), scientist (invents new SF devices and has knowledge
 of the setting's scientific principles), unique (one-of-a-kind esper or
 alien), or any of a number of templates that the GM has designed for standard
 SF creatures in her setting.

 dog and ship's engineering officer (unique); and Tira, a shape-changing
 alien (based on an alien template the GM has created for this campaign).
 Once you've found the right Template for your concept, fill in the blanks
 in the Template with descriptions of your character's particular abilities
 (and weaknesses).
 There are three kinds of things needing descriptions at this point: Powers,
 Restrictions, and Shticks.
 Each template has some slots for Powers and Shticks, and some have places
 for Restrictions.
 Powers are abilities that can be used in or out of combat, Shticks are
 strictly non-combat abilities, and Restrictions are biological or technological
 limitations on your character.
 The Template might have some of these pre-defined, or give broad categories
 they should fall into.
 Others will be completely up to you to decide.
 Unless they are pre-defined by the Template, you need to to define what
 they are and how they work.

For example, the Crew template has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but you can define this as a psychological ploy to

 until help arrives,

 where alien creatures ignore your presence, Luck, Athleticism, Danger sense,
 Invisibility, Force Shield, or whatever ability of that general type best
 suits your character concept.
 On the other hand, an Alien: Mara template might gives all Mara the same
 Shapeshift and Empathy powers.
 These do not need to be defined, the template already specifies what they
 do.

Powers and Shticks descriptions are free-form; there is no fixed list of
 possibilities.
 They have numerical ratings that tell how effective they are when used,
 but it's up to you to determine what they are, and how and when they can
 be used.
 Restrictions are completely binding on your character, so they are not
 given numerical ratings.
 E.g., No matter how powerful a Mara is, ultrasonics render it helpless, period.

 You then have a certain number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boosts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to spend on your character, usually 3.
 These increase your character's abilities.
 Each Boost can be spent for one of the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Add one to one of the four Attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and Actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage.
 2 Boosts give it a big Advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add one new Power.
 The starting level is given in your template.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one Shtick
 at one higher level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Get a Major Asset (companion, base, vehicle, organization, or wealth).
 You can then spend additional Boosts to improve these.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Get three Minor Assets (perks, contacts, favors, rank, equipment).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Adjust Abilities (Powers and Shticks).

\series default
 You can adjust your Abilities further by reducing the effectiveness of
 certain aspects of the Ability in order to increase its Level or take some
 Advantages on it.
 Every Small Disadvantage you put on the Ability gives you one Boost to
 spend on Advantages for that Power or to raise its Level; every Big Disadvantag
e gives you two Boosts.
 Similarly, for each Level you lower the Ability you get an additional Boost
 to spend on that Power.
 You can't trade Boosts from one Ability to spend on another.
 Modifying an Ability this way doesn't affect how many total Boosts you
 have, so doesn't change how much XP you need for a new Boost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Pick Complications.

\series default
 All protagonists have life issues that complicate their attempts to achieve
 their goals.
 If you're employed by the Space Patrol and they send you on missions, or
 if you suffer from fatigue if you spend more than two hours under normal
 Earth gravity because you were raised in space, that's a Complication.
 Choose Complications that will provide conflict for your character, or
 make the conflicts that much more interesting.
 Most characters pick one major and two minor complications; characters
 using the Crew template have the option of picking 4 minor complications
 instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Flesh out your character.

\series default
 Now add colorful details that make your character more lifelike.
 There are a few mechanical decisions to be made here, but mostly this is
 you thinking through what your character's life is really like.
 For example, is your character affiliated with any organization or alliance
 of similar characters, e.g., Star Fleet or the Space Patrol? If so, what
 is their role in the organization? Give your character some back-story,
 and think about her day-to-day life.
 What causes her to brave dangers and the unknown, rather than holding down
 a safe unadventurous job? (Assuming such jobs exist in the campaign setting;
 in a post-apocalyptic world every day might be a struggle for survival
 no matter who you are.) Write down the basic motivation as a Drive.
 Think about your character's appearance.
 How does your character appear to others? What image do they project? Write
 down a short description.
 If you are artistic, you could even draw a picture of your character, or
 find a suitable image on the Internet.

\begin_layout Standard
You can actually start play with nothing but a character concept, and defer
 describing abilities and assigning numbers to them until specific abilities
 are needed.
 Pick one of the Templates or one of the sample characters, so that you
 know what the numbers for various abilities will start at.
 Then, each time you want to do something that calls for a roll and that
 isn't covered by one of the Abilities you've already assigned, assign an
 ability on the spot that covers it, writing over one of the abilities of
 the Template or sample character.
 If you're using a Template, don't forget you can also assign the starting
 Boosts as you go if you want a number to be higher or more abilities than
 just the starting ones.

\begin_layout Chapter
Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While there are no fixed rules for picking a character concept, there are
 a few issues to think about when considering a possible character.
 A good way to generate a character concept is to modify a fictional character
 you enjoy.
 But not every character that's fun to see or read about is fun to play.
 Some issues to think about are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the character fit the tone of the game? Playing a pure comic relief
 character in a very serious game, or a melodramatic character in a light-hearte
d game, can grow old quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the character have a distinctive personality? Would the other players
 be able to tell the difference between you playing this character and you
 playing other characters? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the character play well with others? Usually, you'll be playing as
 part of a team.
 Depending on the tone of the setting, characters often have dark secrets,
 personality flaws, and secret agendas that conflict with other characters.
 Sometimes they're just not very nice, to each other or to the rest of the
 world.
 But you can be a nasty person and still a team player.
 On the Firefly, characters like Jane or Book are often shown in conflict
 with the rest of the gang.
 But they still function as valuable members of the group.
 As long as tension creates interplay between the PCs, it is good.
 It is only when it blocks interaction that it's a problem.
 On the other hand, goody-goody characters that everyone likes might actually
 be bad for interesting team play.
 Will your character have interesting, distinctive relationships with the
 other PCs, having both friends and rivals on the team? A team player character
 contributes to group goals, but doesn't overwhelm everyone else's contribution.
 Think about typical scenes featuring your character.
 Where would others fit in? If your character is always alone in these scenes,
 always the star, or always on the sidelines, you might want to revise the
 character.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How does the character contribute to different kinds of group activities?
 Science Fiction will tend to have a different balance of activities than
 many other genres such as high fantasy or super-heroics.
 About equal time will usually be spent in investigation (including scientific
 research and fiddling with equipment), negotiation and interacting with
 NPCs, and combat.
 Try to make sure that your character has a role to play in all of these.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In SF you are often up against the totally unknown.
 Investigation and research is a large part of the game, uncovering what
 you are dealing with, whether it's a being or a natural phenomenon, whether
 you must fight it, bypass it, or even incorporate it into your plans in
 order to achieve your goals and how you might do that.
 Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

is very flexible, and you don't have to be a scientist, detective, or telepath
 to help in investigations.
 Maybe you know a lot of people.
 Maybe you have good transportation or unusual senses.
 Maybe you just intimidate people into divulging the key information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not every being you encounter will be a foe, nor will every foe be defeat-able.
 Negotiation is about identifying and agreeing on common interests with
 beings that are suspicious of you.
 This is particularly important when dealing with representatives of larger
 groups, such as alien races or organizations.
 Brute force might escalate until the whole organization is up against your
 group.
 Again, you don't have to be a trained diplomat to contribute to negotiations.
 Maybe you are politically connected yourself, or maybe you can offer your
 unique services as a bargaining chip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, combat is about kicking enemy butt.
 Zap!'s flexibility means that you can contribute to your group's combat
 success in a host of ways, not just as Mobile Infantry or with psychic
 powers.
 Your mundane character's attitude might make more of a difference than
 the bad-ass's big guns.
 If you can think of ways to combine your abilities with others', you can
 supplement their combat power.
 This can be as simple as distracting a foe while they attack.
 You can also help by assisting teammates to recover from attacks.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How well can you portray this character? Sometimes a character that you
 love to watch isn't a character that you want to play.
 If it's important that your character is alien, can you give it alien beliefs
 and desires, at least from time to time so that it's more than just a human
 with a bumpy forehead? Can you be as nasty as your PC, or are you a softy
 at heart? Do you really want to brood all the time, or do you burst if
 you can't crack wise?

Aliens in Zap!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different approaches you could take to playing an alien
 character in Zap! You could make your alien race a Shtick or a Power, use
 the Unique Template, or use an entirely new Template specific to that alien
 race in the setting.
 Which approach you use depends on how much your character concept focuses
 on being a representative member of that alien race vs.
 it being background flavor while other aspects of your character such as
 chosen profession take center stage.
 Two players might both be members of the same alien race and take different
 approaches to designing their characters depending on what they want to
 emphasize.
 One might choose to be the ship's security officer, choosing the Bad-ass
 Template and making his membership in his proud warrior race, the Klangons,
 just one of his four Shticks; the other might make his alien status central
 to his character concept by using the Klangon Template devised by the GM
 and relegating his status as captain of the ship's marines to one of that
 Template's slots for Shticks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an alien character template.

 The GM may also have created new SF creature templates for the setting,
 so ask about other possibilities.

 Once you've picked a Template, you fill out the Template with specific
 Abilities (Powers and Shticks) according to your concept.
 You give each ability slot in the template a name, and a brief description.
 Although they don't change the mechanics of using the abilities this free-form
 description really determines what the ability is.
 Throughout the game you'll be able to use the ability precisely when the
 game situation matches the description.
 While some abilities might seem more limited than others, the challenge
 is to provide creative justifications for the ability being useful.
 So, for example, if your power is Strength it cannot be used directly at
 a distance.
 This doesn't need to be spelled out or compensated for; it's implicit in
 the notion of physical strength.
 But that doesn't mean that you can never use the power in a ranged attack,
 just that you need to use it indirectly.
 You can say you are using your Strength to pick up a large object and hurl
 it at your foe, or to cause the building they are in to collapse by knocking
 away a support beam, or to intimidate them by a display of violence.
 In any of these ways you use your Strength you resolve your degree of success
 using the same mechanics and the same dice.
 Your free-form descriptions tell you when and how you can use your abilities.
 Then the mechanics indicate whether you succeed and by how much.

\begin_layout Subsection
Powers vs.
 Shticks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abilities come in two forms: Powers and Shticks.
 Anything that can be used to attack and defend in combat is a Power, even
 if it may have other uses.
 Anything that can't typically be used to hurt somebody or defend yourself
 against being hurt is a Shtick.
 The same sort of Ability might be a Power for one character and a Shtick
 for another, depending on how the player sees themselves using the Ability
 in the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the name Powers suggests superhuman abilities, in Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Powers are a generic term for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 kind of Ability that can be used to attack or defend against attacks.
 So training with a gun is a Power, as is the Ability to lie convincingly,
 since it can be used to prevent an enemy from attacking you.
 On the other hand, maybe your Ability to empathically 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

discern lies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a Shtick, rather than a Power, since it would almost never be used to
 attack or defend in combat.
 Even something like Computer Programming, which would normally be a Shtick
 that takes minutes or hours to use effectively could be a Power if you
 envision it being fast and effective enough to, say, seize control of robots
 as they're attacking you and have them fight on your side instead.
 Note that sometimes the Primary Rule would imply that a Shtick could be
 used to defend yourself.
 E.g.
 if a creature had a Power to create illusions that it uses to lure people
 into danger, an Ability to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Empathically Discern Lies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be a plausible defense, even if it had been characterized as a Shtick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Powers can also be used outside of combat.
 For example, you could have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keen Sense of Smell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a Power or a Shtick.
 Either way, you could use the Ability to sniff out drugs in a locker or
 track someone through the woods, but you can only use it directly to give
 you a defense against an invisible attacker if it is a Power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Customizing Abilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can customize your abilities with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:AdvantagesAndDisadvantages"

\end_inset

, however the main thing that makes your abilities unique is the free-form
 description, and you don't need to spell out the consequences in terms
 of any mechanics.
 If your Power is Flame Blast, then it goes without saying that this power
 doesn't work in water or in a vacuum, and it might be dangerous to use
 in a zeppelin.
 On the other hand, it also goes without saying that you can also use the
 Power to light up a dark room or to provide warmth if the party is caught
 in a blizzard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you described your Power as Psychic Flames instead of physical flames,
 and specify that it creates an illusion in enemies minds that convinces
 them they're burning, then although it will usually work just like a Flame
 Blast, there's no reason it shouldn't work under water.
 You likely won't be able to light things on fire with it, or light up a
 room, but physical armor would probably provide no defense.
 All of these advantages and disadvantages are implicit in the description,
 and do not need to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bought.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a Power has an especially wide range of applications, particularly if
 you can use it not only as an attack and defense, but also to move things
 around, manipulate them, influence their actions and so forth you should
 take the Flexible

Advantage
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 on the Power.
 If the Power is so versatile that it's easier to list what you cannot use
 it for than what you can, such as for something like Psionics, then the
 Ultra-Flexible

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 applies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition there are two mechanical variations on Powers that are neither
 Advantages or Disadvantages: Movement Powers and Automatic Powers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\series bold
Movement
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Movement
\end_layout

\end_inset

 powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Movement Powers primarily let you move around.
 They may also be used to attack or defend when that makes sense, e.g., using
 fly to ram into a foe, or super speed to dodge bullets.
 Movement Powers do not take an Action to use if they are used for movement;
 if you use them for anything else they take an Action and only get to roll
 one die (the larger die).
 Like any other power, you cannot use it more than once a round, so you
 cannot use a Movement power both to move and attack or defend.
 Without a Movement power you can still move in combat, but it will take
 an Action to move any significant distance, and you'll be at a disadvantage
 if you're trying to move while anything else is interfering with it, such
 as infected mutants grabbing at your ankles or the heaving of the ship's
 deck making it difficult to walk.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatic powers are used in response to a certain kind of action.
 They can be used multiple times in a round, and do not require an Action
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Automatic!Actions and
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to use.
 On the other hand, they cannot normally be used at will, unless you can
 force the trigger condition to be met.
 What those conditions are and what the Power does (whether it's an attack,
 a defense, or movement) should be clear from the description.
 An Automatic Power must be either for Attack
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Attack!Automatic Powers and
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or Defense
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Defense!Automatic Powers and
\end_layout

\end_inset

, not both, and to have an attack be automatic is an Advantage.
 For instance, Armor could be an automatic Defense that would be used whenever
 you were physically attacked.
 Flame Body could be automatic Attack that would be used whenever you were
 grabbed.
 Automatic Defenses defend against every appropriate incoming attack, automatic
 Offenses attack everyone who meets the proper conditions.
 If using a Power triggers an Automatic Power, the Automatic Power Combines

\end_inset


\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Combinations!Automatic Powers and
\end_layout

\end_inset

 with the first Power, giving it a +1.
 For example, if you use your Super-Strength to grab someone, your Flame
 Body automatic attack would always combine with it.
 You roll the dice for Super-Strength, but add 1 to the result for the Flame
 Body.
 If you use Super-Strength to throw something at someone, Flame Body wouldn't
 apply, so you would get no bonus.
 Automatic Defenses cannot be hindered or disabled unless they have the
 Can Be Hindered Disadvantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What Counts as a Power?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are often several possible ways to divide your abilities up into powers.
 If you can psionically cause people to sleep, find you persuasive, or become
 confused, do you want these to be three separate powers or one power called
 Telempathy? If you have a suit of Powered Armor that increases your strength,
 provides you protection and life support, and has mini-missiles one the
 shoulders and a blaster built into the chest, you could have one Power
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Powered Armor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or five separate Powers your armor gives you.
 The difference is that with the first option you could use at most one
 of your armor's powers each round, but with the second you could potentially
 use your armor in five different ways each round (if you have enough Actions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You do not need to purchase Powers that are for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

color
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than for combat advantage.
 Your character can turn televisions or lights on and off with a glance
 without a special power.
 Only buy it as a Power instead of a Shtick if you plan to be able to use
 it to harm or defend against a foe, possibly by distracting them (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keep 'Em Talking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a perfectly viable automatic defense, though the Primary Rule would
 imply it could only be used against things that understand your language).
 If the Power you have in mind isn't actually directly useful in combat,
 it is probably better to treat it as color and not list it as a power.
 For example, a werewolf can change into a wolf, but what makes that useful
 is that the wolf form has claws and fangs, a superior sense of smell, and
 regenerates.
 On the other hand, you cannot go through life as a wolf, because it's hard
 to turn doorknobs.
 So you don't have to list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shift into wolf form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a power; instead, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only usable in wolf form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be minor Disadvantages
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 on some of your powers, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Claws and Fangs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is assumed that given enough time and resources, without distractions
 or opposition, a Scientist can do pretty much anything the setting's science
 will allow.
 If you are not a scientist, you know one you can bribe, beguile, seduce,
 or intimidate.
 So you can accomplish all kinds of stuff in downtime without needing a
 separate power listed on your sheet.
 If the setting's technology allows you to regrow somebody's full body as
 long as you save the head, you don't have to list that as a Power, you
 just have to justify how you manage to get access to the appropriate facilities
 to repair your injured companions.
 Just make sure your descriptions of your downtime activities are consistent
 with your character concept.
 Your downtime activities will also be fodder for GM plots, so abuse of
 this rule will often backfire on you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What Counts as a Shtick?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything that cannot plausibly be used on its own for attacking or defending
 is a Shtick.
 Many Shticks are used to do research and gather information, to operate
 and repair equipment, to influence other characters in social situations,
 or to enhance Powers in combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that Shticks can be used in Combination with Powers to attack or defend,
 as long as it makes sense according to the Primary Rule, e.g.
 you can Combine your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keen Sense of Smell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Shtick with your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Catlike Reflexes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Power to give yourself a better chance against an invisible attacker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under unusual circumstances the Primary Rule may dictate that a Shtick actually
 be used directly to attack or defend; usually this is the result of the
 target having a Restriction or Complication that makes this possible.
 If a creature has the Restriction 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ultra-sensitive hearing, can be hurt by high pitched noises
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then a Shtick such as Opera Singer could be used as an attack by describing
 how you sing an E above high C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mechanics for Abilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each power has a numerical rating, which determines two dice to roll when
 using your Ability.
 Sometimes there is also a fixed number to add in to one or both dice.
 When you use your Ability, you roll both kinds of dice, and add in the
 modifier if any.
 You take the higher of the two as your result.
 If the Ability is opposing another character's Ability, they do the same,
 and the bigger value is the one who succeeds; the difference determines
 how big the success was.
 If someone succeeds on an attack against you, you are usually Hindered.
 That means that you only roll the larger die when you use a power, until
 you or someone else takes an action to free you from the hindering effect.
 The table describes what dice correspond to what power levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You only roll an uncontested Ability if it is not absolutely clear that
 you could use the Ability for that purpose, or if you have reason to care
 whether it takes several tries or extra time and effort to succeed; if
 you have all the time in the world, just assume that you would get the
 maximum that you could roll on the dice and go from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Roll the two dice listed and take the higher result.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you never add the dice together.

 follow an easy to remember pattern up to 12.
 At even levels you use two dice of the same size, and that size matches
 the level (Power Level 4 is d4, d4; Power Level 6 is d6, d6; Power Level
 8 is d8, d8...).
 Odd levels have one die of the next higher level and one of the next lower
 (Power Level 5 is a d6 and a d4, Power Level 7 is a d8 and a d6, Power
 Level 9 is a d10 and a d8...).
 It gets a tiny bit trickier once you get past d12: past d12 the dice go
 d8+5, d10+5, d12+5, d8+10, d10+10, and so on.
 However, since at any given Scope the Powers and Shticks begin at around
 PL 4-6, it will be quite a while before that becomes an issue.

 is slightly special, in that it starts off as a slightly weaker power and
 can be upgraded during the course of an adventure by doing Research into
 the nature of whatever the PCs are facing in order to tailor the power
 specifically to what's currently necessary.
 There are three variations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Starting with an Ultra-Flexible power that can do most anything but is at
 low level and can Power Up through Research to a higher level; 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all three variations, the procedure for doing Research remains the same:
 you must, over the course of the adventure, engage in 
\series bold
three
\series default
 separate scenes that revolve around your character and your allies doing
 the necessary Research into the device or scientific principle you're trying
 to create, using your Research Shtick.
 In most cases the

 Research Shtick
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 should work without a roll.
 If a roll
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Research!When to roll
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is required because the player is unsure whether their type of science
 really can accomplish what they're aiming to do (say a neuroscientist whose
 powers operate on brains is trying to research a device to deactivate a
 robot), the GM should assign a difficulty based on the power level of the
 target; if the roll fails, the Scientist can't try again in that scene,
 and will have to come up with some other approach to moving the research
 forward or a different sort of device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, you might have a scene where you and possibly your allies
 are using the ship's computer records to identify the creature attacking
 the colonists; a scene where you go to the mine where the colonists were
 attacked to recover alien tissues that the device requires; and a scene
 where you use the ship's lab and that tissue to create a device capable
 of paralyzing the creature.
 The exact nature of the scenes should be determined during play, through
 the players and GM deciding what's plausible given what's been going on
 so far, rather than a cookie-cutter approach: computer library, tissue,
 lab.
 It's justifying what your character is doing as an occasion to employ the
 Research Shtick; the requirement that there be three such scenes and that
 the scenes be different is just to prevent every adventure from turning
 into a wait while the Scientist character hangs around in the ship's lab
 until the device is ready.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you perform three successful scenes in which you are doing research
 (scenes where the focus is research and you score a success with your Research
 Shtick if necessary), your device is ready, and you announce what it does.
 It should be one very specific effect, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shrink giant insects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paralyze methane-breathing creatures.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 While you should be researching during this time, that doesn't mean you
 can't participate in scenes.
 You can put down your tools and zap the creature attacking you in the lab,
 or go out to the scene of the crime and collect scientific samples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you decide a roll ought to be required other PCs can assist you by using
 their investigative abilities to perform relevant research.
 The difficulty is set to be the base power level of the intended target.

Advantages and Disadvantages
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Advantages are aspects that make a Ability more useful, and Disadvantages
 are things that makes it less useful.
 For instance if a Ability is exceptionally Flexible so that almost anything
 can be justified according to the Primary Rule, that's an Advantage; if
 a Ability has a more limited use than normal, for instance it can only
 be used to defend against cold-based attacks, that's a Disadvantage.
 There are both Big and Small Advantages and Disadvantages (labeled AA and
 A, or DD and D), and their effects on a Ability are cumulative.
 A Small Advantage on a Ability costs one Boost, a Big Advantage costs 2,
 a Small Disadvantage gives you an extra Boost to spend on that Ability,
 and a Big Disadvantage gives you two extra Boosts on that Ability (you
 may not take a Disadvantage on a Ability in order to get Boosts to spend
 on some other Ability or Attribute).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Abilities!Advantages
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Advantages represent some quality of the Ability that makes it more useful.
 You should only give the Ability an advantage if it represents a significant
 increase in the Ability.
 Many little side effects that might be advantageous under some circumstances
 are already covered by the description.
 For instance, if you have a Sleep Gas Ability it isn't necessary to take
 Exotic even though it's implied that something like a Shield or Tough Hide
 wouldn't be useful as a defense.
 Other fairly common Abilities like Life Support or Immunity to Poison would
 clearly stop the Ability altogether, while still others would depend on
 how they were described as being used (e.g., using Reflexes to jump out of
 the way, or Control Wind to blow it away) and so would get to roll for
 defense.
 Exotic would be required for something like Psionic Assault, or Time stop,
 since it's quite difficult to reason through whether it's at all plausible
 for Reflexes or Magic Shield to interfere.
 Note that this depends largely on how you choose to define the Ability:
 if you define it so that Psionic Assault would have to roll against so
 simple a thing as dodging with Reflexes or Acrobatics, or be completely
 negated by Armor or Rocky Hide, then you wouldn't need to justify it with
 the Exotic Advantage.
 (AA) indicates a Big Advantage; (A) a Small Advantage.

 the target with a Control Power will let you force the target to take a
 single Action in the target's Turn; this will use one of the target's Actions
 and one of the target's Abilities (if required) before the target regains
 control; if the target is Hindered by some previous attack, he or she will
 not break free of the Hindrance first unless that's the command, instead
 the Action commanded will be taken while still Hindered.
 
\end_layout

 or a certain amount of time has elapsed.
 You could use this Advantage to create a bomb, or set a trip-wire, or use
 a Power with the Control Advantage to give somebody a post-hypnotic suggestion
 (though in the latter case you would need the Subtle Advantage as well
 or the target would know about it).

\begin_layout Description
Exotic
\series medium

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\series bold
(AA)
\series default
 An Exotic attack can't be defended against by ordinary Abilities, so targets
 use the Default Skill instead.
 E.g., A mystic curse or psychic bolt can't be usually be stopped by armor
 or a force-field.
 Exotic attacks must define a fairly broad class of circumstances that automatic
ally negate them (e.g., any magical defense, any unusual metabolism, Abilities
 being based on technology, being a non-magical creature, etc).
 In addition, Defenses which are Flexible or Ultra-Flexible should get their
 normal roll unless there's clearly no way they could help.
 Things like poison gas or blinding flashes of light are not Exotic, in
 and of themselves, because ordinary Powers or even Shticks (such as having
 Life Support built into your suit, or Lightning Reflexes to close your
 eyes) could justify a defense roll if they don't negate the Power completely.
 You may have only one Exotic Power, unless all your Exotic Powers are negated
 by the same circumstances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Flexible
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\series bold
(A)
\series default
 The Ability can justify a wide range of effects (e.g., electromagnetic powers).
 Whether a Ability should be counted as Flexible or not is up to the player;
 generally a Power that's mostly used for attacking or defending, with occasiona
l use for extra things that directly follow from its nature (such as a lightning
 bolt short-circuiting electronics) doesn't need the Flexible Advantage
 even if it can take many forms, such as a lightning bolt, a ball of lightning,
 grabbing someone to shock them, and so on; a Ability that's intended to
 be used to do many things beside simple attack and defense, such as picking
 up objects, holding things, fencing them off, gathering or concealing informati
on, and the like should be given the Flexible Advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Larger
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Scope
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(AA) The Ability operates one Scope higher than normal; this doesn't change
 the Power Level, even when used versus targets at the normal Scope, it
 merely changes the interpretation of the Ability in terms of things like
 weight, speed, area, range, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Ultra-Flexible
\series bold

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(AA)
\series default
 The Ability can justify almost any effect (e.g., Sorcery); you must still
 choose some things that are beyond its capabilities.
 Ultra-Flexible is like Flexible, but with even more applications.
 Where a Flexible Power might be one that can pick up or push things in
 addition to attack and defense, or can create an illusion in addition to
 attack and defense, an Ultra-Flexible Power is one that could do all those
 and more.
 A typical Ultra-Flexible Power is one where it is harder to think of things
 that it shouldn't be permitted to do rather than things that it should.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Persistent
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\series bold
(AA)
\series default
 The Ability will remain in effect as long as you spend your entire turn
 maintaining it, and no external force interferes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Power-up
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\series bold
(A)
\series default
 The power level can be increased, under some circumstances, or at a cost
 or risk.
 Pick a Large Disadvantage, and a way of spending two Boosts on the Ability
 (e.g., +2 power level, one Large Advantage, 2 Small Advantages, or +1 level
 and a Small Advantage) The Ability can be used at the higher level if the
 character takes the Disadvantage for that use.
 If the Disadvantage affects future uses of the Ability, e..g, Burnout, it
 affects the entire Ability, not just the power-up.
 It must be a Disadvantage that makes sense for a single use.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Subtle
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\series bold
(A)
\series default
 It's not obvious that the Ability is being used, unless you have a Ability
 that grants you appropriate senses.
 Telepathy or Mind Control are typical Abilities that benefit from this
 Advantage, but it could apply to something more prosaic, like an invisible
 Sleep gas.

Disadvantages represent some Disadvantage that makes the Ability less useful
 than the Primary Rule would otherwise allow.
 It is not intended that you place Disadvantages on Abilities merely to
 represent the Disadvantages that such a Ability would naturally have given
 the Primary Rule.
 For instance, even though fire requires oxygen and can only burn flammable
 materials, you wouldn't take Circumstanced Limited to represent it not
 working without oxygen, or not harming things that aren't flammable unless
 the intent was to make it even more vulnerable to those circumstances than
 you would assume such as requiring high concentrations of oxygen as from
 a tank of compressed oxygen, or only capable of damaging things at all
 if they are as easily combustible as, say, paper.

(D) automatic defenses normally are only reduced to a single die when Disabled

 this Power can be interfered with as if it were a Regular Power instead;
 e.g., if Captain Patriot took his Shield as a automatic Defense (so he can
 use it to defend without having to spend an Action), ordinarily attackers
 couldn't totally Disable it at all.
 Since that doesn't make complete sense (if they physically take it away,
 how would he still defend with it?) he takes as automatic Can be Disabled
 meaning when somebody can Disable it as if it were a Regular Power.
 automatics that Can Be Disabled still roll both dice to resist.

A Note On Flexibility
\series default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:ANoteOnFlexibility"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike some of the other Advantages, Flexible and Ultra-Flexible advantages
 aren't very sharply defined.
 Even having a Power that represented a variety of equivalent attacks that
 differ in such minor things as whether they're melee or ranged or the exact
 flavor of damage, such as being armed with a sword and a bow, or having
 a suit that has wrist-blasters, laser eye-beams, and a chest cannon doesn't
 really make the Power much more Flexible as long as conceptually the powers
 do the same sorts of things, such as damage targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's when the Ability can be either be altered on the fly or has a number
 of completely distinct uses so that it can take advantage of the Primary
 Rule to do a wide variety of different things that it becomes an issue.
 For instance, since a sword and a gun would in general both be straightforward
 attacks (kinetic energy, even) there's no need to apply the Flexible Advantage
 to a Power that represents having both.
 On the other hand, if your Power is a gun that can switch between firing
 a laser and lifting things via gravitational force or generating illusions
 of scary monsters, that probably should be given the Flexible Advantage
 to make up for being able to use the Power in an especially wide set of
 circumstances.
 Similarly if your Ability is a utility belt that contains a bunch of different
 things such as handcuffs, lock-picks, listening devices, a cutting torch,
 and a flash-bang grenade, that would be represented by the Flexible Advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally with the Flexible Advantage you should be able to define what
 it does in advance, and should limit yourself to no more than the Ability
 Level in different aspects at once, so the aforementioned Utility Belt
 with five tricks would require PL 5.
 That doesn't preclude using the Primary Rule to come up with new clever
 uses for, say, handcuffs, but it should preclude suddenly discovering a
 new device that's just what you need for the situation in there.
 If it makes sense, you are free to change the list of what your Flexible
 Ability does (e.g.
 what tricks you are carrying in your utility belt) between adventures,
 or if you return to your base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultra-Flexible Abilities, on the other hand, represent those that have uses
 too numerous to list out in advance, or that can be reconfigured 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on the fly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the hero.
 With a utility belt using the Ultra-Flexible advantage, you are allowed
 to just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

discover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that you've packed away a can of aerosol shark-repellant for just this
 occasion, or (in a more serious vein) that you have the chemicals needed
 to whip something like that up on a moment's notice.
 With Ultra-Flexible Abilities you should be scrupulous in defining in advance
 categories of things that the Ability 
\emph on
cannot
\emph default
 do.
 Generally the Ultra-Flexible Ability should have either one small restriction
 per PL above 6 (such as can't affect targets with a completely inhuman
 metabolism) or half that many large restrictions (such as can't affect
 inanimate objects, or targets with no mind).
 More powerful Ultra-Flexible Abilities thus are more restricted, but they're
 much more dangerous because they can be tailored to the immediate situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flexibility should 
\shape italic
not
\shape default
 be used just to have a bunch of different attacks to tailor them to bypass
 the target's defenses; if you wish to have a Power that is particularly
 hard to defend against, take the Exotic advantage instead, or in addition.
 Flexibility is meant to give you more options in how you describe using
 your Power and the tasks it can apply to, not just a straight mechanical
 advantage in knocking foes out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any event, Flexibility has no bearing on whether a Power goes against
 Toughness, Stamina, or Will: that is determined by the Primary Rule description
 of how the Power is being used.
 A Laser Gun might be an attack against Toughness if fired directly against
 a foe, against Stamina if it were used to rupture a nearby coolant line
 to release a choking cloud of gas, or even against Will if you were snapping
 off shots trying to force the foes to keep under cover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether to represent several different things that you can do as a single
 Power with the Flexible Advantage or take several different Powers is a
 matter of style.
 Since you can only use a Power once per Round, if you envision using it
 two different ways in the same Round, or it seems implausible to you that
 using say, your powered armor's chest beam should preclude you using its
 life-support at the same time, you should take the powers separately.

New Advantages and Disadvantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

 The list of Advantages and Disadvantages is not exhaustive, and you can
 consult with the GM and other players about new ones you'd like to add.
 Before you do, though, you should consider whether it can be handled by
 one of the existing ones, some of which are quite broad, or by a Complication,
 or just by applying the Primary Rule given how you imagine the Power working.
 Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

discourages min-maxing (tweaking characters to get the maximum effectiveness
 for the minimum drawbacks), so before you add a new Advantage or Disadvantage
 you should really consider whether it's necessary to capture the concept
 of the Power and not just an excuse to be able afford an extra Power or
 Advantage or to make the Power useful out of all proportion to its Power
 Level.
 One quick test is if you wouldn't mind if the enemies start employing the
 same Advantage or Disadvantage on their Powers, it's probably okay.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some Disadvantages such as Erratic or Side-Effects only trigger when the
 hero rolls a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mishap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on an attempt to use the power.
 Mishaps never occur outside the context of these Disadvantages, so most
 of the time you don't have to consider it.
 Mishaps don't occur if the use of the power doesn't require a roll, unless
 the hero has the Frequent Mishaps Disadvantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the power has such a Disadvantage then if a roll on the power comes up
 
\series bold
doubles
\series default
, there is a chance of a Mishap.
 Roll a d12 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confirm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whether there's a Mishap: if you roll less than or equal to the die-size
 of the highest die, then a Mishap has occurred and the Disadvantage takes
 effect.
 E.g.
 a PL 7 (d6, d4) power has Burn-Out as a Disadvantage: the player rolls
 3, 3 which means there's a chance of a Mishap.
 She rolls a d12, and if she gets a 6 or less the power burns out.
 Disadvantages that have a chance of Mishap will occur 1/12 of the time
 (powers rolling bigger dice have less chance of doubles, but more chance
 that doubles are confirmed as a Mishap).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a Power that can have a Mishap has been reduced to a single die, such
 as when you are Hindered, instead of checking for doubles roll a d12.
 On a roll of 12 a Mishap occurs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Alternate Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If players find it simpler they can roll a separate d12 Mishap die whenever
 they roll a power with such a Disadvantage, and the Mishap occurs on a
 roll of 12, regardless of what the other dice show.
 The odds of Mishap are the same, but it requires rolling more dice since
 you roll the Mishap die every time and not just when doubles come up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientists and Uniques need to choose a Restriction.
 A fixed set of Restrictions will be part of the templates for most alien
 creatures.
 Restrictions should be severe enough that they could be used to definite
 strategic advantage by a foe that knows about you, while not crippling
 your character for play.
 Below are several kinds of restriction for inspiration; this is not meant
 as a complete list, but suggests how severe restrictions ought to be.
 You can group minor restrictions together, especially of the same kind,
 to make a more serious restriction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Addiction: You need a certain unusual substance or activity to survive,
 or are compelled to seek it.
 If you are deprived of this substance, you can be distracted by its presence.
 This counts as being hindered until you obtain it or it is removed from
 your presence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Alter
\begin_inset space ~

Ego: Under some circumstances, your body is taken over by a personality
 that doesn't take your wishes into account.
 For example, a human host of an alien symbiont might generally be the dominant
 personality but sometimes find the alien in control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Aversion: You find a common substance unpleasant to be around, e.g., a desert-worl
d alien that hates water.
 You will avoid it if at all possible, and if suddenly presented with it,
 will cringe away.
 This usually takes one Action.
 You cannot usually be affected multiple times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Block: There is a common activity that you cannot do.
 For example, a cyborg might be unable to swim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Compulsion: Under some circumstance, you must do something whether you wish
 to or not.
 You lose control of your actions until this is finished.
 For example, a shapeshifting alien might be required to spend one hour
 out of 24 in a liquid state, unable to take any actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Ritual: You need to undertake a daily ritual to keep your powers or stay
 healthy.
 If you don't get the chance to perform the ritual, your powers are hindered
 or disabled until you can do it.
 For instance, certain kinds of robots might need to recharge daily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Susceptibility: A certain substance hurts you.
 You are hindered while in its presence, and it may eventually be fatal.
 Example: a methane-breathing alien might find oxygen poisonous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Taboo: You are not permitted to do something that most people do.
 If you do it, major portions of your power will be blocked until the situation
 is remedied.
 E.g.
 A robot might be programmed to obey the Three Laws of Robotics, and malfunction
 or become catatonic if it ever accidentally harmed a human
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Vulnerability: A certain substance or kind of attack hurts you disproportionatel
y.
 E.g.
 an alien with really sensitive hearing that is more easily hurt by sonic
 attacks.
 Your defenses against this kind of attack count as hindered, even the automatic
 ones, so you only roll one die for each defense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Spending your Boosts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have a certain number of Boosts to spend on your character, usually
 3.
 As you gain experience, you will be able to purchase more Boosts.
 The number of XP you need to get an additional Boost is equal to your current
 number of Boosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Boost can be spent for one of the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add one to one of the four attributes: Toughness, Stamina, Will, and Actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increase one power by 1 level or give it a small Advantage.
 2 Boosts give it a big Advantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increase two Shticks by 1 level each, or one Shtick by 2 levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add one new power.
 The starting level is given in your template.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add two new Shticks at the starting level in your template, or one Shtick
 at one higher level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Get a companion, base, or vehicle.
 You can then spend additional Boosts to improve these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Get three Assets.
 Assets are things like Favors, Contacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may increase an Ability by giving that Ability Disadvantages; a Small
 Disadvantage lets you increase it by 1 or give it a Small Advantage; a
 Big Disadvantage lets you: increase it by 2; add 2 Small Advantages; increase
 by 1 and add one Small Advantage; add a Big Advantage.

 even if you don't end up rolling the dice, as does manipulating objects

 For instance, if you use your Ice Mastery Power to create a slide to catch

 Powers can be used multiple times in a Round and don't cost an Action to

 When creating your character you usually want to balance your number of
 Powers with your Actions.
 If you have many Powers but few Actions, you won't use most of your Powers
 in any one Round, although it gives you a wide variety of Powers to pick
 from.
 If you have many Actions but few regular Powers, many of your Actions will
 be spent assisting teammates to recover or performing tasks that don't

 so on.

 If you are the crew of a starship, the ship can belong to all of you.
 If a group shares an Asset, they can divide up the costs arbitrarily.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Boost gets you a Companion with all Attributes 1, three powers at 5,
 and two Shticks at 4.
 Experience points spent on Companions don't increase your hero's Boosts
 (and hence, do not increase the XP Cost to buy future Boosts for you),
 but do increase Boosts a costs for the Companion.
 It costs 1 XP to give your Companion 1 Boost.
 From then on, it costs XP equal to the total number of Boosts your Companion
 already has to give it an additional Boost.
 So a second XP gives it a second Boost, then 2 more XP are required to
 give it a third.
 If you want to give your Companions extra Boosts to start, you can trade
 one of your Boosts for 3 XP and spend that on your Companion or other Assets.
\end_layout

Certain kinds of Science Fiction stories, notably Cyberpunk, have much of
 the activity take place in cyberspace or a virtual reality.
 If this is a once-in-a-while activity in the game, it can be handled as
 an ordinary Power (e.g.
 Hacking, Cybersystems) but if it's going to be the basis of a lot of the
 action, the characters can have Avatars, which are complete characters
 in their own right that exist only in the VR/cyberspace setting.
 One Boost gets you an Avatar that's a complete character, using whatever
 Template you choose; it need not be the same Template as the real-world
 version of the character.
 When you are using your Avatar in cyberspace, your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatspace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character is absorbed in what it's doing and gets no Actions.
 XP that you earn can be spent on improving the Avatar instead in the same
 way that you would improve your own character.
 The Avatar will interact with objects and other Avatars in cyberspace just
 as characters do in the game-world, though the way that cyberspace looks
 and behaves according to the Primary Rule may vary considerably from the
 way the meatspace world works; the GM and the players should take extra
 care to discuss how it ought to work to avoid clashing assumptions and
 styles.

 Some characters have special Vehicles that allow them to get to where the

 Vehicles need not be at the same Scope as the characters.
 Ones at the same Scope take the characters from place to place within an
 adventure or can be used in combat scenes.
 Spaceships will generally be on a completely different Scope from the character
s, and have their own Chapter on designing and using them (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Vehicles can carry teammates and cargo as well as you.
 You don't need a Vehicle as an Asset to have a driver's license and car.
 Only purchase a Vehicle if it has special abilities of its own, or you
 actually use it in a fight.
 A land-speeder is just a hovercraft that takes you to the dives in the
 starport.
 That wouldn't count as a Vehicle.
 But Serenity, the ship in Firefly, is almost a character in its own right,
 and would certainly be bought as a Vehicle.

 You can give your Vehicle Boosts as you would a Companion.
 The first Boost costs 1 XP, then the second 2, and so on.
 This does not count towards increasing your own Boosts.
 If you trade one of your initial Boosts for 3 XP, you can thus use this
 to improve your starting Vehicle by two Boosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vehicles start with only Toughness as an Attribute, but you can purchase
 Will and Actions.
 A Vehicle with 0 Actions can still use its Movement power to move, since
 that costs 0 Actions.
 To use any other power, or to use the Vehicles Movement to attack or defend,
 you would need to use one of your own Actions.
 If you buy your Vehicle at least one Action, it can perform independent
 actions.
 If it has zero Will, your character must have trained or programmed it
 explicitly for these actions.
 If it has a Will of at least 1, it has some kind of intelligence, and can
 react to circumstances without explicit input from you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use a Boost to buy a spaceship, starting with one of the base
 Ship Templates (equivalent to 10 Wealth Points); some campaigns may be
 based around the players all being crew on a much more powerful Ship, in
 which case the GM should just design the ship using whatever budget seems
 sensible and the players need not spend any Boosts to have it as an Asset.

Characters often require a base of operations, where they can store their
 equipment and mementos of their past adventures, keep their labs and scientific
 equipment, and recharge their robotic bodies.
 One Boost gets you an area or structure of any description, suitable for
 occupation.
 It could be a building in an office park, a secret asteroid base, a research
 compound on a private island, or perhaps a huge warehouse in the middle
 of nowhere.
 The structure will have Toughness 4 and other Attributes 0.
 It will have two Shticks at 4 usable by anyone inside, such as Research
 Library or First-Aid Kit.
 XP can be spent to improve a base, just like for Companions and Vehicles.
 You can give a base Attributes, Powers and Shticks.
 Powers and Shticks are only usable inside the base, or at the perimeter,
 as appropriate.
 If you don't give it any Actions, someone inside needs to use an Action
 to trigger any non-Automatic Power.
 If you give it Actions but no Will, the powers are programmable, following
 simple commands, and do not require someone else to spend Actions.
 If you give it a positive Will, there is some computer or other intelligence
 that controls the base's powers, and can act independently.

Base Advantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:BaseAdvantages"

\end_inset

 These Advantages apply only to Powers that belong to the base, and apply
 to a specific Power of the base; you can't, for instance, take the Advantage
 Remote-Controlled as an advantage on the entire base and have it apply
 to all the Powers in the base 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for free.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A base's Powers may also have Advantages from the regular list, where appropria
te.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Remote-Controlled
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(A) Remote-Controlled Powers can be activated by a hero from outside the
 base, as long as he's still within the Scope; the Power would still take
 effect within the base (though for some things, like looking up records
 on a computer, that's not really a Disadvantage).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Long-Ranged
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(AA) Long-Ranged Powers can be operated from within the base but targeted
 at things outside of the base, as long as they're still in-Scope.
 Powers would also need the Remote-Controlled advantage to be operated from
 outside of the base to target something outside of the base, e.g., a Teleporter
 that a hero could use to travel to the base.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Larger
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Scope
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(AA) Larger Scope Powers can operate at a Scope above that of the base;
 this advantage can be taken multiple times, each time increasing the Power
 up by one level of Scope.
 A City-Scope base could thus have a scanner that could monitor an entire
 Region, or a teleporter capable of Interplanetary jumps.

Minor Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some characters have special equipment, or perks, like security clearance
 or law-enforcement authority, some have contacts in the underworld or with
 the police, some are owed a big favor by somebody with unusual resources
 or power, and some are well-known enough to influence people's reactions
 to them for good or ill.
 These aren't exactly Abilities, but they are capabilities that are similar
 in some ways.
 Minor Assets come in several flavors: Equipment, Perks, Contacts, Favors,
 Wealth and Rank.
 At creation a character can spend one Boost on 
\series bold
three
\series default
 Minor Assets appropriate to their Personal Scope.
 That is, if the Personal Scope is Scope 5 (City), then their contact has
 City-wide information/power/authority such as the Chief of Police or Mayor,
 anchor of the local news, owner of a local company, while a National-Scope
 Contact might be the President, CEO of a nation-wide corporation, star
 of a nationally broadcast television program, or a Supreme Court Justice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minor Assets can be adjusted up or down from the base Scope two-for-one.
 So a City Contact could be traded for two Neighborhood contacts, or four
 Street-level contacts; in the other direction two City Contacts could be
 traded for one Regional Contact, and four could be traded for one National
 Contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When rolling for the effect of a Minor Asset, that is where it's not obvious
 from the nature of the Minor Asset and the Primary Rule whether it would
 apply or be effective, roll the Asset's PL vs.
 a Difficulty commensurate with the Scope.
 (See Difficulty for Other Tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:DifficultyForOtherTasks"

\end_inset

.) Minor Assets begin at PL 4 unless otherwise stated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When spending XP, you can choose to purchase new Minor Assets, and XP spent
 on Minor Assets doesn't increase your hero's Boosts.
 One point of XP (not one Boost) purchases 1 Minor Asset at the current
 Scope; increasing the Minor Asset's PL by 1 costs 1 
\emph on
XP
\emph default
 for the first increase, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Equipment
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Equipment"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters can begin with equipment appropriate to their Abilities for free;
 the die-size of the Equipment is equal to the lower die of the appropriate
 Power or Shtick, so this would be helpful in narrating what they can do,
 but wouldn't actually increase the roll.
 E.g.
 if the character has a power Photon Sword at PL 5, then a d4 Photon Sword
 would be free (since PL 5 rolls a d6 and a d4); if the PL had been 6, then
 the Photon Sword would start at 6.
 Spending 1 XP increases the 
\emph on
die-size
\emph default
 by one, 2 XP to increase it again, and so on; thus for one Boost (3 XP),
 that could become a d8 Photon Sword.
 See

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Perk is a special dispensation or benefit that comes from the role the
 character plays in the community or with an organization.
 For instance, a character might be deputized by the local police force,
 allowing him to make legally sanctioned arrests, but requiring him to follow
 the same rules as to probable cause and evidence that the police follow.
 Another character might have security clearance with the Federal Government,
 or even a far-flung stellar empire.
 The effects and restrictions for having a Perk are worked out through the
 Primary Rule, though the GM might call for a roll of the Perk against the
 Difficulty if there's some doubt as to whether the requested use is truly
 sanctioned by the Perk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Contacts"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Contact is somebody with access to information or authority who can prove
 useful to the character.
 A contact might be a snitch in the local underworld, a pal in the Star
 Knight records department, the head of Interstellar Security Service, and
 so on, depending on the Scope.
 Contacts will cooperate with the character in areas that are within their
 competency and authority, but won't risk their lives or their careers to
 help.
 Contacts might also call upon the character to reciprocate.
 The effects and restrictions for having a Contact are worked out through
 the Primary Rule, though the GM might call for a roll of the Contact's
 PL vs.
 the Difficulty if there's some doubt as to whether the contact really has
 the information or authority needed.
 You don't need a separate roll to see if the Contact will help; the roll
 of the Contact's PL vs.
 the Difficulty covers that: failure could indicate the Contact won't help
 or can't help, depending on the Primary Rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Contact that would readily risk life and career to help the character
 should be taken as if it were a Companion, even if the contact would almost
 never accompany the character on an adventure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Favors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Favors"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Favor is something big that somebody owes the character--big enough that
 they might actually risk their life or career to help.
 Favors need not be owed to the character by Contacts or friends: the local
 gang lord might owe the hero a debt of honor for saving the gang lord's
 daughter's life, for instance.
 Favors can only be called in once, and then are gone.
 You don't usually need to roll to see if the person who owes you the favor
 will cooperate, but the GM might roll as with Contacts above if there's
 some doubt whether the favor being asked for is actually within the debtor's
 power to grant; if there's some reason that the person isn't actually in
 the position to grant the favor, the favor isn't used up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Wealth
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Wealth"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the campaign is using the optional 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "chap:Wealth"

\end_inset

 rules, characters can start with Wealth as a Minor Asset.
 Wealth starts at 4, and can be increased like any Minor Asset (1 XP for
 the first increase, 2 for the second, etc.) but unlike most Minor Assets
 is likely to increase or decrease during play, and not just as a result
 of spending XP.
 If Wealth decreases during play, characters don't get any XP they spent
 back.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "chap:Wealth"

\end_inset

 for a full discussion of how Wealth is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're not using the Wealth rules, or even if you are, characters can
 be wealthy as part of their background or as a Shtick, but that doesn't
 translate directly into buying and selling things; instead it's handled
 narratively as part of the Primary Rule.
 I.e.
 a character might justify trying to bribe her way to see the Emperor with
 her Wealthy Shtick, but shouldn't just buy everybody on her ship d10 Powered
 Armor by appealing to her Shtick instead of spending XP for it under the
 Equipment rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rank
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Rank"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A character may have a rank within a particular organization; rank acts
 much like a Contact, but it's the character's own authority that's being
 exercised.
 The rank should be commensurate with the character's 
\emph on
Adventure
\emph default
 Scope, rather than Personal Scope.
 You can be a general without being able to fight like an army.
 Roll the PL in Rank vs.
 the Difficulty set by the GM to determine whether your rank grants you
 sufficient authority.
 If you roll a Mishap while pulling rank, there should be repercussions,
 though the order may still be carried out if the roll was a success.

Complications

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Complications"

\end_inset

 Every good character has things that complicate life and add drama.
 It might be that in the eyes of the law, you are a dangerous criminal,
 or maybe your uncle wants you to stay home and be a moisture farmer instead
 of joining Star Academy.
 Perhaps you are poor, and have to struggle to earn enough credits to keep
 your rust-bucket starship flying.
 You should choose Complications to highlight themes you want to be dealing
 with in the game.
 Complications are invitations to the GM to focus on a particular aspect
 of your character or kind of adventure you'd like to have.
 Every Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

character has roughly the same number and severity of Complications.
 You are perfectly free to change your character's Complications between
 adventures; if you want to stop focusing on your money problems for a while
 you can tell the GM that and substitute a new Complication...perhaps you become
 the target of a local crime lord, who wants to recruit you as a smuggler.
 Removing poverty as a Complication doesn't necessarily mean that you're
 wealthy now, only that trying to earn enough credits for day-to-day ship's
 expenses and repairs shouldn't crop up frequently in adventures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most characters take one Big Complication and two Small Complications.
 Crew have the option of having 4 Small Complications instead, since their
 problems may be less of a character hook.
 A Big Complication is something that will crop up almost all the time,
 and will form one of the main themes of the character.
 Not every adventure will incorporate it, but it will come as no great surprise
 if one does.
 A Small Complication is one that only has an occasional impact, though
 it might be a big deal when it does, or if it crops up frequently it does
 so in a minor way.
 Complications can be chosen to be Big or Small depending on your preference.
 As a Small Complication, being Wanted by the Law might mean that you can't
 go to the police to ask for information or assistance, and you leave your
 neatly-wrapped foes for them to find, bugging out before they can arrest
 you too.
 As a Big Complication, the police might actually try to arrest you in the
 middle of a battle, or even aid your foe thinking that he must be one of
 the good guys because he's fighting you!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Complications are a way to focus the attention on your character,
 you don't want to take Complications that everyone in your group will have,
 such as Hates Evil or Takes Risks.

 Try to avoid thinking of Complications as part of a price you have to pay
 to the GM in order to play a cool alien creature or kick-ass cyborg warrior;
 that can lead to picking a Complication that will annoy you when it crops
 up...but you're not playing the game in order to be annoyed, and it's not
 the GM's job to keep you from having too much fun.
 Ideally you should be looking forward to your Complications coming up in
 an adventure, because it throws the spotlight on your hero and gives you
 a chance to either have some drama or be clever and engage in lateral thinking.
 Kryptonite wasn't introduced into Superman's mythos in order to make it
 more fair, it was created to make it more interesting.
 Having to rescue somebody from an area strewn with Kryptonite presented
 a challenge that couldn't be solved by a straight application of his awesome
 powers.
 When you choose Complications you should be thinking in terms of what sort
 of problems would you like to be presented with during play and whether
 those will actually be fun for you to deal with.
 Don't over-think it, though; remember, in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

when you get tired of a Complication you can simply set it aside and replace
 it with a new one.
 Ultimately the goal of Complications is to help the GM drive the game in
 directions that you find interesting.

Drive is a description of your character's primary motivation, what makes
 her go off and explore strange new worlds and seek out new civilizations.
 It could be curiosity, duty, vengeance, the desire for personal power,

 Your Drive will help you role-play your character, and help the GM come

 What happened before your character decided to adventure? Did you attend
 an Academy that trained you? Were you kidnapped from your home-world? Did
 you stow away on a starship, seeking adventure or just an escape from the
 slums where you were born? Or is it just a job to you, not an adventure
 at all? Who are your family and friends? What do you do for a living? Describe
 the character's back story in as much or as little detail as you like.
 This is your opportunity to flesh out who your character is and what she
 can do other than fight.
 You can add details about the character's civilian life, profession and
 hobbies, friends and family, skills and training, notable past adventures,
 and whatever else you think is relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your back story need not be completely determined at the start of play.
 Serial fiction is full of revelations of previously unmentioned background
 details, from members of your family having been killed decades before
 by this episode's villain, to the big bad actually being your father and
 your love interest your sister.
 Players should feel free to Retcon their character's pasts, though they
 should probably clear it with the GM before they do the kind that actually
 contradicts prior versions of the story, just in case the GM had built
 it into the campaign in a way that would be hard to fix.

\begin_layout Standard
Think about what image your character projects.
 How will others see her or him? Usually, your appearance is related to
 your true nature in one of three ways.
 Your appearance could reflect your true nature (a bad-ass who looks every
 bit a bad-ass), it could be adopted deliberately to hide your true nature
 (a bad-ass who looks like Casper Milquetoast because being underestimated
 is useful), or it could be an ironic contrast to or statement about your
 true nature (the big scary-looking alien who's poetic and sensitive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, a picture or description can help you resolve issues when it
 comes to applying the Primary Rule.
 There will often come times when you need to know whether your hero wears
 a closed helmet, say, or gloves, or has any accessible gadgets hanging
 from her belt; in these situations a picture can be worth a thousand words.
 Working out such details in advance, incidental to designing your hero's
 appearance, can speed play and free you from worrying about whether you're
 being fair.

 Here are some aliens suitable for PCs reminiscent of various SF tales.
 Most campaigns would replace these or at least add new ones to flesh out
 the setting.
 Aliens should be designed to be able to work along side of humans (possibly
 using high technology) or whatever the baseline sophont of the setting
 is, e.g.
 no aliens that can only survive in an atmosphere that would be poisonous
 to all the other player characters unless being trapped in an environment
 suit is part of the challenge of playing that alien.
