# Atomic Tomorrow Adventures: Character Progress Tracks

## Overview

These four progress tracks give players concrete goals tied to their personal motivations, providing clear advancement paths beyond traditional leveling. Each track functions both as a narrative measure of achievement and as a rollable skill (Track Rating × 10) for appropriate situations.

---

## Fortune (Economic Power)
**Scale**: Annual income/assets = 10^Fortune

### Examples
- **Fortune 3**: $1,000/year (comfortable citizen)
- **Fortune 5**: $100,000/year (successful business owner)
- **Fortune 7**: $10,000,000/year (interplanetary mogul)
- **Fortune 10**: $10,000,000,000/year (galactic economic force)

### Advancement Opportunities
- Major business deals and successful ventures
- Treasure discoveries and valuable salvage
- Patents on atomic innovations
- Establishing profitable trade routes
- Successful speculation on colony development

### Mechanical Use
Roll Fortune × 10 when wealth could provide access or influence beyond simple purchases - reaching politicians, gaining entry to exclusive circles, leveraging economic pressure, or accessing services that money alone can't buy.

## Fame (Public Recognition)
**Scale**: Order of magnitude of people who recognize you from recent media coverage

### Examples
- **Fame 3**: 1,000 people (local colony news)
- **Fame 5**: 100,000 people (planetary broadcasts)
- **Fame 8**: 100,000,000 people (Solar System-wide coverage)
- **Fame 10**: 10,000,000,000 people (legendary across all human space)

### Advancement & Decay
- **Current Fame**: Peak media reach in the last month
- **Sustained Fame**: Consistent background recognition level
- Current Fame decays by 1 point every 2-3 months without reinforcement
- Sustained Fame increases only with prolonged high Current Fame
- Major scandals can permanently damage Sustained Fame

### Advancement Opportunities
- Heroic public acts and dramatic rescues
- Scientific breakthroughs and discoveries
- Entertainment achievements and performances
- Notorious exploits (positive or negative)
- First contact situations and historic moments

### Mechanical Use
Roll Fame × 10 for social situations where recognition opens doors - exclusive invitations, priority reservations, media access, or leveraging celebrity status for influence.

## Challenge (Personal Achievement Rarity)
**Scale**: How rare your personal accomplishments are in human history

### Rarity Levels
**6-10: Pure Rarity** (no modifiers needed)
- **Challenge 6**: Fewer than 100,000 people have ever done this
- **Challenge 7**: Fewer than 10,000 people have ever done this
- **Challenge 8**: Fewer than 1,000 people have ever done this
- **Challenge 9**: Fewer than 100 people have ever done this
- **Challenge 10**: Fewer than 10 people have ever done this

**1-5: Modified Accomplishments**
- Base requirement: Same as Challenge 6 (fewer than 100,000)
- Each modifier bumps rating up 1 level
- **Modifiers**: First from your planet/settlement, first in over a decade, youngest/oldest to accomplish it, under extreme conditions, using new methods

### Challenge Points & Decay
- Each accomplishment awards points equal to its Challenge rating
- Overall Challenge rating = total points ÷ 10 (rounded down)
- Points decay by 1 per year without new accomplishments
- Encourages continued boundary-pushing rather than resting on past achievements

### Examples
- **Challenge 4**: "First Terran to solo-climb Olympus Mons during dust storm season"
- **Challenge 7**: "One of only 30 humans to escape from inside a Mysterian mothership"
- **Challenge 9**: "Third person ever to establish communication with Titan's hydrocarbon entities"

### Mechanical Use
After each adventure, roll Challenge × 10. Success grants one skill advancement check of your choice (following normal advancement rules) without requiring a critical success during the adventure.

## Curiosity (Knowledge & Exploration)
**Scale**: Combination of discovery impact and personal exploration

### Two Advancement Paths

**Discovery Impact** (high value, rare):
- Major discoveries affecting 10^X people
- Revolutionary inventions and paradigm shifts
- First contact and historic breakthroughs
- Awards points equal to the discovery's impact rating

**Personal Exploration** (moderate value, accessible):
- **+1 point**: First-time visits to significant locations
- **+1 point**: Learning new fields of knowledge or languages
- **+1 point**: Extended cultural immersion experiences
- **+1 point**: Following interesting leads (even unsuccessful ones)
- **+2 points**: Being first from your world/culture to experience something

### Examples
- **Curiosity 4**: Visited major sites across 3 planets, speaks 4 languages, made minor archaeological discovery
- **Curiosity 7**: Extensive travels, multiple fields of expertise, significant contributions to xenobiology
- **Curiosity 10**: Legendary explorer whose discoveries reshaped human understanding

### Mechanical Use
GM rolls Curiosity × 10 in secret when there's something to discover that players haven't explicitly searched for. Success means the character's naturally inquisitive nature led them to notice, examine, or try something that reveals the hidden element. This represents the character's background curiosity working even when the player isn't specifically investigating.
