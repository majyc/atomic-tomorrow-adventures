# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## SKILL ADVANCEMENT

Skill advancement in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures follows the principle that we learn most from our moments of exceptional success and from challenging ourselves. Characters improve organically through play rather than through arbitrary experience point accumulation.

### MARKING FOR ADVANCEMENT

During an adventure, mark a skill for potential advancement whenever:

1. **You roll a critical success with the skill** (any doubles below your skill percentage)
2. **You succeed at a particularly difficult or dramatic use of the skill** (GM's discretion)
3. **You succeed with the skill in a life-threatening or high-stakes situation**

You can mark each skill only once per adventure, regardless of how many times you achieve the above conditions.

### ADVANCEMENT ROLLS

At the end of each adventure:

1. For each marked skill, roll d100 against your **current skill percentage**
2. If you **fail** the roll (roll above your current percentage), you've found room for improvement
3. Increase the skill by 1d6 percentage points, subject to the plateau restrictions below

### SKILL PLATEAUS AND MASTERY

As skills reach higher levels, advancement becomes more difficult, representing the increasing challenge of improving already exceptional abilities:

- **Skilled (50-69%)**: Skills at this level only improve on a roll of 1-4 on the improvement die
- **Expert (70-89%)**: Skills at this level only improve on a roll of 1-3 on the improvement die
- **Master (90%+)**: Skills at this level only improve on a roll of 1 on the improvement die

### ADVANCEMENT EXAMPLE

**Scenario**: Daring Jack, a Rocket Jockey, performs a spectacular emergency landing during an ion storm, rolling a critical success on his Pilot skill check.

1. Jack's player marks Pilot (currently 65%) for advancement
2. At the end of the adventure, Jack's player rolls 83 against his Pilot skill of 65%
3. This is a failure, so Jack gets to improve the skill
4. Jack's player rolls a d6 and gets a 5, increasing his Pilot skill to 70%
5. Since Pilot is now at 70%, it has reached the Expert plateau, making future improvements more challenging

### LEARNING NEW SKILLS

Characters can attempt to use skills they don't formally possess at the base attribute value × 2. If they succeed and the skill would qualify for advancement, they can establish the skill at attribute × 2 + 1d6%.

Alternatively, characters can spend downtime between adventures learning new skills:
1. Choose a skill and a suitable teacher or learning resource
2. Begin with a base chance equal to attribute × 2
3. After suitable training time (GM's discretion), gain the skill at attribute × 2 + 10%

### ATTRIBUTE ADVANCEMENT

Attributes improve more slowly than skills, representing the challenge of changing fundamental capabilities:

1. When a character accumulates three critical successes using a particular attribute (not skills based on that attribute), they may attempt to improve it
2. Roll d100 against the attribute × 5
3. If the roll fails, increase the attribute by 1 point (maximum 18)
