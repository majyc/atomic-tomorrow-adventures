# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: PSIONIC SYSTEM

## CORE CONCEPT

In the Atomic Tomorrow universe, psychic potential exists in all humans but usually remains dormant. Only through training, genetic predisposition, or extraordinary circumstances does this latent ability manifest. The Rhine Institute was established to identify, train, and monitor those with active psionic capabilities—both for their safety and society's.

## PSI SKILL

Psychic ability is represented by a single percentile skill:

- **Psi Skill**: The percentage chance to successfully use any psionic power
- **Starting Value**: Based on background + (NERVE modifier × 2)
  - Untrained: 0%
  - Sensitive: 20-30%
  - Natural Talent: 30-50%
  - Red Martian: 30-50%
  - Rhine Institute Graduate: 40-60%
  - Military Psi-Corps: 40-60%

## USING PSIONIC POWERS

### BASIC PROCEDURE

1. **Declare Intent**: Player describes the specific psionic effect they want to create
2. **Determine Difficulty**: Referee assigns modifiers based on range, complexity, etc.
3. **Roll Percentile**: Player rolls against their current Psi Skill percentage (adjusted for difficulty)
4. **Apply Strain**: Successful use reduces Psi Skill by the power's strain cost (reduced by training)
5. **Determine Results**: Referee interprets the outcome based on success quality

### RESISTANCE

When psionic powers are used against unwilling targets, the target resists with the most appropriate attribute:

- **BRAWN × 5%**: Against telekinetic forces trying to physically move or restrain
- **REFLEX × 5%**: Against powers requiring quick mental reactions or evasion
- **NERVE × 5%**: Against fear projection, emotional manipulation, or psychic pressure
- **SAVVY × 5%**: Against illusions, false sensory input, or deceptive suggestions
- **CHARM × 5%**: Against attempts to manipulate social dynamics or personal connections
- **GRIT × 5%**: Against direct mental attacks, pain induction, or psychic domination
- **GUILE × 5%**: Against mind reading, memory extraction, or deception detection

This creates an opposed roll situation:
- If the psychic succeeds and the target fails, the power works completely
- If both succeed, the higher successful roll wins
- If both fail, nothing happens (but strain is minimal)
- If the psychic fails and the target succeeds, the target may sense the attempt

### SUCCESS QUALITY

Psionic actions follow the same success quality system as other skills:

- **Critical Success** (matching doubles under skill): Enhanced effect with no strain
- **Special Success** (roll ending in 0 or 5 under skill): Enhanced effect with half strain
- **Ordinary Success** (roll under skill): Standard effect with normal strain
- **Failure** (roll over skill): No effect, -5% Psi Skill strain
- **Special Failure** (roll ending in 0 or 5 over skill): No effect, -10% Psi Skill strain
- **Critical Failure** (matching doubles over skill): Psionic feedback (see below)

## PSI STRAIN AND RECOVERY

### DUAL STRAIN SYSTEM

Psionic strain is tracked in two complementary ways:

1. **Psi Skill Reduction**: Using powers directly reduces your skill percentage
2. **Psionic Strain Track**: Tracks physical and mental symptoms of overexertion

### PSI SKILL REDUCTION

Each use of a psionic power costs:
- **Minor Powers**: -5% Psi Skill per use
- **Moderate Powers**: -10% Psi Skill per use
- **Major Powers**: -15% Psi Skill per use
- **Extreme Powers**: -20% Psi Skill or more per use

Failure also reduces Psi Skill:
- **Ordinary Failure**: -5% Psi Skill
- **Special Failure**: -10% Psi Skill
- **Critical Failure**: -20% Psi Skill plus additional effects

When your Psi Skill reaches 0%, you cannot use powers until recovery.

### PSIONIC STRAIN TRACK

Tracks the physical toll of using psychic abilities:

1. **Clear**: No penalties
2. **Strained**: -10% penalty to all skills, mild headache
3. **Fatigued**: -20% penalty to all skills, nosebleeds and visible strain
4. **Critical**: -40% penalty to all skills, severe pain and trembling
5. **Burnout**: Unconsciousness (see below), Psi Skill drops to 0%

Advancing on this track happens when:
- A critical failure occurs on a Psi Skill roll (if no buffer remains)
- A special failure occurs while already at Fatigued or worse
- Using powers while at 10% or less of your Psi Skill

Recovery on this track occurs at one step per day of rest or intensive care.

### BURNOUT UNCONSCIOUSNESS

When a psychic reaches Burnout level on the strain track:
1. Character must make a GRIT × 5% roll
2. The ones die of this roll determines unconsciousness duration in hours
3. On critical failure, unconsciousness lasts for a full day
4. On special success or better, character remains conscious but at -60% to all actions

### PSI SKILL RECOVERY

The Psi Skill percentage itself recovers at:
- **Normal Rest**: +5% per hour
- **Meditation**: +10% per hour (requires complete concentration)
- **Deep Sleep**: +15% per hour
- **Psionic Stimulants**: Immediate boost but advances strain track

### PSIONIC FEEDBACK

Critical failures can cause dangerous feedback effects:
- Psi Skill immediately drops by 20%
- Character advances one step on the Psionic Strain track (if no buffer remains)
- Character suffers 1 wound
- Roll on the Feedback Effects table for additional complications

## PSIONIC TRAINING

Training in specific powers provides two distinct benefits:

### 1. FIXED STRAIN REDUCTION

Training reduces the strain cost of using powers:
- **Trained**: -1% for Minor, -2% for Moderate, -3% for Major, -4% for Extreme
- **Specialized**: -2% for Minor, -4% for Moderate, -6% for Major, -8% for Extreme
- **Mastered**: -3% for Minor, -6% for Moderate, -9% for Major, -12% for Extreme

### 2. STRAIN BUFFER

Each power has its own buffer against causing strain track advancement:
- **Untrained**: No buffer (critical failures immediately advance strain track)
- **Trained**: 1 buffer point (absorbs one critical failure)
- **Specialized**: 2 buffer points (absorbs two critical failures)
- **Mastered**: 3 buffer points (absorbs three critical failures)

Buffer points refresh when the character fully recovers their Psi Skill to maximum.

### STARTING TRAINING LEVELS

Beginning psychics typically have:
- 1-2 powers at Specialized level
- 2-3 powers at Trained level
- Remaining powers Untrained

Red Martians automatically have Telepathy: Mental Communication at Specialized level.

## THE RHINE INSTITUTE

Founded in 1976 after early ESP research discovered potentially dangerous uncontrolled psychics, the Rhine Institute maintains facilities on Terra, Luna, and Mars.

### PRIMARY FUNCTIONS

- **Identification**: Testing for psionic potential among the population
- **Training**: Structured development of abilities in controlled environments
- **Certification**: Official licensing of Espers for legal practice
- **Regulation**: Oversight of psionic activity and intervention when necessary
- **Research**: Ongoing study of psionic phenomena and applications
- **Protection**: Providing resources and safe havens for psychics

### LEGAL STATUS

In most jurisdictions, unlicensed use of psionic abilities is illegal, particularly for:

- Commercial purposes
- Investigation
- Mental influence
- Gathering restricted information
- Use against unwilling subjects

Licensed Espers receive credentials indicating their training level and authorized applications. Different jurisdictions have varying regulations, with Luna being the most permissive and Terra the most restrictive.

## PSIONIC EQUIPMENT

### AMPLIFIERS
Devices that extend effective range by one category (Near becomes Far, etc.) for specific applications. Using an amplifier adds +5% strain to each use.

### DAMPENERS
Worn by powerful psychics to prevent accidental power manifestation. Reduces Psi Skill by 50% but prevents random manifestations. May be legally required in some locations.

### FOCUSING CRYSTALS
Specially grown crystals that reduce strain cost by 3% when used during psionic activities.

### PSI-BLOCKERS
Create local "dead zones" where psionic abilities are impaired (-30% to -60%) or completely blocked.

### PSYCHIC STIMULANTS
Drugs that temporarily boost Psi Skill by +10% to +30% but automatically advance the user on the Psionic Strain track. Repeated use causes dependency.

### PSI-DETECTION EQUIPMENT
Devices that identify and measure psionic activity in an area. Standard equipment for security at major facilities and government buildings.

## FEEDBACK EFFECTS TABLE

When a critical failure occurs, roll 1d10 on this table after applying the standard consequences:

1. **Inverted Effect**: Power manifests with opposite of intended effect
2. **Misdirected Power**: Effect targets random person/object in vicinity
3. **Power Surge**: Random psionic effect manifests (referee's choice)
4. **Sensory Overload**: Blinded and deafened for 1d6 minutes
5. **Memory Flash**: Vivid hallucination from past or potential future
6. **Psionic Echo**: Power randomly repeats 1d3 times in next 24 hours
7. **Emotional Projection**: Strong emotions affect everyone in Near range
8. **Psychological Imprint**: Temporary personality change lasting hours
9. **Neural Disruption**: Physical tremors and coordination issues (-40% to physical actions)
0. **System Shock**: Additional wound and advance another step on strain track

## ADVANCEMENT

Characters improve their psionic abilities through use and training:

### PSI SKILL ADVANCEMENT

When a character achieves a critical success with their Psi Skill during an adventure, the skill is marked for potential advancement.

At the adventure's conclusion:
1. Roll percentile dice against the character's current maximum Psi Skill percentage
2. If the roll exceeds the current percentage, the character must choose ONE of:
   - Increase Psi Skill by 1d6%
   - Improve training level in one specific power

This creates a strategic choice between becoming broadly more effective (helping all powers) or specializing in a specific power (reducing strain for just that ability).

### TRAINING LEVEL PROGRESSION

Training levels advance through the following progression:
- Untrained → Trained → Specialized → Mastered

Advancing a power's training level provides both greater strain reduction and additional buffer points against strain track advancement.
