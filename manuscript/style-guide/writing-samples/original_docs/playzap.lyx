\begin_layout Standard
Here's a quick summary of the mechanical options in Zap! Any option you
 take must be justified by describing what you're doing according to the
 Primary Rule.
 Further details on each are supplied in the following chapters, but this
 is the essence of the game.

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\size normal
Defend
\series default
 Defend with an Automatic or spend an Action to defend with a regular Power.
 If Attacker's roll beats yours, you are Hindered; if it beats it by 
\size default
\emph on
more
\size normal
\emph default

\size default
Out
\size normal
 (vs.
 Toughness)/Tired (vs.

 Will).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Counter
\series default
\size normal
 Spend Action to roll Ability against Ability to prevent it succeeding;
 Countered character can choose not to contest the roll but abort instead
 (reuse the action and Ability for something else), or can spend an 
\size default
\emph on
extra
\size normal
\emph default
 Action to use a different Ability to contest the Counter roll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\size normal
Combine
\series default
 Each participant spends one Action per Ability they are contributing.
 Roll dice based on which Ability's Advantages you want to use, +1 per Ability
 involved (Max bonus = number of players, no more than +1 from any one character
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tropes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tropes are variations on the basic rules that provide a better fit for specific
 things typical of the genre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\size normal
Wild Shot
\series default
 Swap 2 matched dice for 1 die next size higher (or drop low die for +1
 on high if mismatched).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Disable
\series default
 Power vs.
 Ability to temporarily disable the target Ability; Hinder means it's unusable
 until the owner spends an Action; Out is unusable until the owner spends
 a Turn fixing it; Overkill needs out-of-combat repair.
 Automatic Defenses are immune, unless the attacking Power has the Disabling
 Only Advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Failure is Not an Option!
\series default
\size normal
 Can opt to become Hindered to change a non-combat roll to highest possible
 (if this would require a larger adjustment than your Stamina, become Tired).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\size normal
Splitting Powers
\series default
 Split roll into single die at two different targets, -1 die size for each
 doubling of number of targets after that.
 (4 targets is -1, 8 is -2, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\size normal
Intimidate
\series default
 spend an Action to Attack vs.
 Best Power and Will to cow foe, (Hinder = hesitates/considers cooperating,
 Out = surrenders/flees); each die reduced by a die-size if vs.
 multiple foes at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Jury Rig
\series default
 cobble together a new Ability by combining Abilities (choose one as base,
 +1 PL for each other contributing power), the contributed Abilities are
 Burned Out for the rest of the Scene; if that's not appropriate the contributor
 becomes Tired instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Powers
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Zap!, most of what a character can do is represented by Abilities; Abilities
 are divided into Powers and Shticks.
 Powers are Abilities potentially useful in combat, Shticks are all other
 Abilities.
 For instance if a character is extremely strong, the character has the
 Power 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Super Strength.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Strength at ordinary levels, even for a gifted athlete, isn't recorded
 and only rarely has any effect on the mechanics of the game.
 Characters are assumed to be relatively normal in every aspect that isn't
 specifically identified as being so exceptionally good as to amount to
 a Power or Shtick, or so bad as to be a Complication.
 You are completely free to choose what your Powers and Shticks are, their
 names, and descriptions of how they work.
 How many you get and how they interact with other Abilities are governed
 by the game mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important aspect of Abilities is conceptual: what does it do? Two
 Abilities might be mechanically identical, but if one is Super Strength,
 and the other is a Laser Beam, how they are used and what they can accomplish
 are different.
 In Zap!, it is never sufficient to simply invoke the Ability and roll the
 dice for the mechanical effect.
 The Primary Rule
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Primary Rule!Powers
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does this sound like an SF story?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be obeyed.
 If the goal is to free a civilian trapped beneath a car, the player could
 use Super Strength to lift the car off, or a Laser Beam to cut the civilian
 free, but if the player can't come up with a plausible way for the Ability
 to accomplish the task (for instance trying to free somebody trapped beneath
 a car with an Ability that can only be used to engulf an area in flames,
 or that creates intangible illusions) then the action isn't permitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that it only needs to be plausible in terms of SF stories; it's not
 recommended that you really try to justify the physics in real-world terms.
 Worrying about whether, even given Super Strength, the character can actually
 find enough leverage and the car has sufficient structural integrity to
 be lifted from particular hand-holds is not something that any but the
 most hard-core SF stories do.
 On the other hand, you don't want to have the game degenerate into farce
 when the character uses Super Strength to just reach in and lift the water
 out of a swimming pool, at least without somebody freezing it first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision of whether a particular use of a Power or Shtick is sufficiently
 SF-plausible in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

should be left up to the players instead of delegated to the GM.
 Players continuously asking whether a particular action is permissible
 will slow things down and interrupt the flow.
 As long as all the players bear in mind that they should be limiting themselves
 to the kind of actions that they would like to read about or see in a movie,
 and avoid the sorts of things that would make them roll their eyes or snicker
 if they were the audience, minor disagreements over plausibility should
 be overlooked to keep the action flowing.
 Remember as well that there's often more than one way to accomplish something
 with an Ability; reaching into a swimming pool and lifting the water out
 with your Super Strength is silly, but stomping the ground so hard the
 swimming pool cracks and the water drains out makes perfect genre sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corollary to the Primary Rule is that in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the description 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 the ability.
 If something sounds like a SF story, it should be valid, even if there
 are no specific game mechanics permitting it.
 The mechanics, and in particular what dice you throw, are there as an aid
 to figuring out what happens when one Power or Shtick is pitted against
 another, or against the circumstances, but the determining factor should
 be what the description of the Ability implies it ought to be able to do.
 How do you know if the Flame Blast can overcome the Ice Shield thrown up
 as a defense? You roll the dice.
 How do you know if the Flame Blast can set a bunch of papers on fire? It
 just can, because that's what makes sense.
 Actions that are squarely within the concept of the Ability don't require
 justification or rolls.
 Actions that are clearly outside of the scope of the Ability shouldn't
 be attempted, no matter how high a Power Level you have.
 Can an Ice Shield protect you against Telepathic Assault? Seems unlikely,
 so don't roll for it.
 Again, if it seems borderline whether it should be allowed or not, go with
 the player's interpretation.
 That puts a lot of power in the hands of the player, but remember: with
 great power comes great responsibility!

Powers!Examples
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Example 1
\series default
: You've given your hero a Power called Clone, which allows him to make
 duplicates of himself.
 When you try to use this Power in combat to create a squad of yourself
 and all tackle the foe, you roll the dice based on the Power Level of your
 Power and compare that to the foe's defenses, just as if you had used a
 Power such as Fire Blast.
 Bear in mind that according to the Primary Rule you might require further
 justification or explanation depending on the circumstance: if the enemy
 is flying hundreds of feet up, just tackling him outright is implausible;
 you would have to further justify the action by doing something like combining
 it with Jump-jets, or being thrown by a companion with Super Strength and
 then Cloning yourself in mid-air once you'd hit the enemy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to use your Clone Power to create a duplicate who will go converse
 with the guards to distract them while the other you sneaks into the warehouse,
 you don't need to roll anything; the description of the Power clearly implies
 that you ought to be able to do that, and that's all it takes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Example 2
\series default
: Your hero has the Power Weather Control, and is trying to prevent the
 enemy space marine from kidnapping the Ambassador.
 Since space marine's powered armor has so far been too tough for your direct
 attacks using Weather Control to create lightning, you decide to try to
 conceal the Ambassador's location by whipping up a fog bank.
 Assuming the space marine has no Power granting him senses that would let
 him penetrate the fog, he'll have to beat your roll on Weather Control
 with his Default Skill in order to locate the Ambassador.
 The effect will last until the space marine uses an appropriate Power to
 blow the fog away, or it disperses naturally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you had chosen to try to blind the space marine directly with your fog,
 you would roll against the space marine's appropriate defense (again the
 Default Skill unless he had an appropriate heightened sense), and if successful
 would result in him being Hindered
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hindered
\end_layout

\end_inset

; it would last until he spent an Action to do something that would clear
 it or move himself out from under.
 In this case, if you had rolled well enough to score an Out, the Out result
 would be interpreted as the space marine stumbling around blindly, unable
 to take effective action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Example 3
\series default
: The enemy is attempting to use his Telekinesis to lift your character
 into the air.
 Your character's Automatic Defense is Invulnerability; while that would
 protect you from a telekinetic blow, there doesn't seem to be any logical
 reason that would prevent it from lifting you, so you wouldn't get to use
 it to defend.
 If your Movement Power were, say, Flight, then it is conceivable that you
 could attempt to resist the Telekinesis by Flying in the opposite direction,
 but you would have to spend an Action to use it (unlike the Automatic Defense);
 also, since it's a Movement Power it would only defend with a single die.
 Because anything that makes sense according to the Primary Rule would be
 allowed, you could also use something like Super Strength to resist by
 grabbing on to a nearby object or even digging your fingers into the ground;
 again that would take an Action and be your one use of that Power in the
 Round.

Primary Rule!Disagreements
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Disagreements or uncertainty over whether the use of an Ability follows
 from the description should be resolved in favor of the player; the GM
 should feel free to point out considerations that the player might have
 overlooked, such as the enemy being hundreds of feet in the air, and encourage
 the player to consider whether the use of the Ability is in keeping with
 the Primary Rule
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Primary Rule!Disagreements
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and to modify or abandon it if it's not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also legitimate for the GM to reveal information that the player might
 not have known that has bearing on the proposed use of the Ability, or
 even render it moot.
 For instance: Ace Astra attempts to use her Freeze Ray-gun to form an ice
 slide to catch a toddler plummeting towards her doom.
 Ordinarily that would be a perfectly valid use of the Power, but if the
 GM knows that it's actually a hologram of a child rather than a real child,
 when the player announces 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I use my Freeze Ray-gun to create a slide and catch her
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the player continues with describing what she'll do once she's caught
 the child, the GM should inform her that the child passes right through
 the slide without stopping or slowing.
 It's possible that in some of these cases the GM should rule that the Ability
 just doesn't work as proposed without revealing exactly why, if there is
 something going on that the character can't be aware of, but the GM should
 make every effort to at least describe to the players what does happen
 or appears to happen instead rather than flatly declaring 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That didn't work.

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 Power Level determines the number of dice rolled when pitting that Ability
 against another Ability or to try and perform some task while under stress,
 as well as how much the Ability can do in real-world terms: how fast, how
 heavy, how big? Each level in Power Level substantially increases the effect,
 ranging from a 50% increase per level at Street Scope to 64 times as much
 per level at Cosmic Scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Power Levels are assigned dice equivalent and when rolling for the effect
 of an Ability, you roll the two dice listed and take the higher result.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}

\begin_layout Standard
Regular Powers can be used to attack or defend, as well as whatever else
 the description of the Power implies; just because Powers can be used in
 combat to attack or defend doesn't mean they can't be used for other purposes.
 On the other hand Shticks 
\emph on
cannot
\emph default
 be used to attack or defend: if it seems plausible that you could use an
 ability to hinder or harm somebody, or to protect yourself, you should
 make it a Power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use a Power to defend during a Round it will defend against all the
 subsequent attacks during the Round as long as there's a reasonable Primary
 Rule explanation of how it applies.
 E.g., once you've decided to use your Powered Armor to defend yourself that
 Round versus an attack with toxic gas by sealing up the vents and going
 to internal oxygen, you will continue to be able to defend against new
 attacks that same Round with your Powered Armor even if it requires a different
 Primary Rule explanation of how the armor ought to apply.
 Even defending with a Power that requires more activity than that, say
 using Acrobatics to jump around and dodge, would apply to all the attacks
 during the Round for which Acrobatics makes sense as a defense.

\begin_layout Standard
Movement Powers primarily let you move around, whether getting to the scene
 of the adventure, chasing a bad-guy or in combat.
 They may also be used to attack or defend, where that makes sense according
 to the Primary Rule (e.g., using fly to ram into a foe, or super speed to
 dodge bullets), and may be combined with other Powers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Movement Powers take an Action if you want to change Range categories or
 use them for attack or defense; when used to attack or defend, Movement
 Powers use only one of their dice.
 Movement with a Movement Power within a Range category doesn't take an
 Action, it's just part of the narration of your turn; if you don't have
 a Movement Power, you are presumed to be using your Default Skill when
 moving around during your turn, and that will take an Action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your Movement Power can open or close Range with a foe by one Range category
 per Round (Combat Range » Pursuit Range » Lost Contact).
 The approximate distance a range increment represents will vary by Scope.
 Combats will either begin at Combat Range, or at Pursuit Range if the character
s first catch sight of the enemies (or vice-verse) at a distance.
 Range doesn't change unless the combatants are deliberately trying to manipulat
e the range to their advantage.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shticks are Abilities that can only be used for things 
\emph on
other than
\emph default
 attack and defense, for instance to heal an ally, or search an area.
 They can be used during combat, as long as they aren't used as an attack
 or defense.
 For example, it's perfectly legitimate to use your Thievery Shtick to attempt
 to pick a lock while a fight rages around you; it's not allowed to use
 your Thievery Shtick to defend yourself from somebody trying to shoot you
 by hiding in shadows or blocking with your lock-picks--if you want to be
 able to do that sort of thing buy it as a Power instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shticks start at the level indicated in your Template (e.g.
 4 for Bad-Asses, 5 for Crew).
 Shticks may take more than one Round to use where that would be logical,
 e.g.
 combing a library for clues is likely to take longer than a fraction of
 one Round.
 If you start to use a Shtick for something that will take several Rounds
 and decide you would rather do something else, you can stop at any time,
 though you won't regain any already spent Actions.
 Whether you can resume your partially completed task later or your effort
 so far will be lost will depend on what would be logical given what you
 were doing.
 A partially-built device will likely wait, a partially-delivered speech
 to rally the troops, not so much.

Shticks

 are what Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}

has instead of such things as skills or talents that are common in other
 systems.
 If you are an extraordinarily good detective, engineer, or archaeologist,
 good enough that you would regularly rely on that ability in your adventures,
 that would be a Shtick; if being a detective or engineer was merely a day
 job that might crop up once in a while depending on the situation, that
 would just be part of your Background.
 Having it as part of your Background doesn't mean you are mediocre at it--you
 might still be world-class, but it does mean that the adventures you have
 don't typically call on your skills in that regard.
 If a roll is required to employ a skill implied by your Background, roll
 the Default Skill (a single d4); if you have nothing in your Background
 that might be applicable you roll a single d2.

Of course, Shticks

 Abilities that you don't intend to use all the time should generally be
 in this category unless it's important that they be useful to attack or
 defend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shticks that can be used for movement are presumed not to be usable in combat.
 E.g., you could have an ordinary helicopter, or even an extraordinary satellite-b
ased teleporter, as a Shtick to get you from mission to mission provided
 it was slow or cumbersome enough that you couldn't use it to flit around
 while fighting.
 If you wanted to be able to fight while using it, you would take it as
 Movement Power or a Vehicle instead.

 Shticks are neither; whether a Shtick requires you to spend an Action depends

 E.g.
 picking a lock would require an Action, while recognizing whether an alien
 is of a known type based on your Xenobiology Shtick would not.

 Each Active Power may only be used once per Round, no matter how many Actions

\shape italic
different
\shape default
 Active Powers as you have Actions.
 Once you spend an Action on an Active Power in order to defend, it will
 continue to defend you until the beginning of your next turn (when you
 would have to spend another Action to renew it), even against new attacks.

 Automatic Powers are used automatically whenever certain conditions are
 met, and don't cost an Action to use.
 What those conditions are and what the Power does are determined when you
 take the Power.
 An Automatic Power may be used either for attack or defense, not both.
 For instance, Armor might be an Automatic Defense that would be used whenever
 you were physically attacked.
 Flaming Body could be Automatic Attack that would be used whenever you
 were grabbed.
 Automatic Defenses defend against every appropriate incoming attack, Automatic
 Attacks attack everyone, friend or foe, who meets the proper conditions.
 Powers that don't directly attack or defend may be chosen as Automatic,
 and will activate whenever is appropriate; a common example might be an
 Automatic sense, which would be active whenever something perceptible was
 within range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatic Powers can combine with other Powers if the conditions for triggering
 the Automatic Power occur at the same time as another Power.
 That is, if you had Flaming Body as an Automatic Attack, and Super Strength,
 and you grabbed somebody with your Super Strength and squeezed them, the
 conditions for the Flaming Body would apply and you could choose to attack
 by Combining your Super Strength and Flaming Body.
 However, whenever you Combine an Automatic Power with another, the base
 power is the 
\emph on
weaker
\emph default
 of the two powers.
 E.g.
 if your Super Strength was PL 10 and your Flaming Body was PL 6, the Combinatio
n would be an attack at PL6+1, not PL10+1.
 You would have to spend an Action for your Super Strength, but not for
 your Automatic Flaming Body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatic Movement moves you whenever the proper condition occurs, e.g., a
 enemy might have an Automatic Teleport that emergency teleports him back
 to his lair when he is Out; Automatic Movement Powers can take effect even
 if you've already moved that round, or even if you're Out as in the example,
 but they can never be used to attack or defend, nor activated except by
 meeting the proper conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Senses as Powers or Shticks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Senses should generally be bought as a Powers, unless there's a good reason
 they can't be used to defend you by alerting you to danger or let you attack
 something that you couldn't otherwise sense.
 E.g.
 a Mind Meld where you have to touch the target and concentrate deeply could
 be a Shtick.
 Whether senses are Automatic or not depends

 on whether you have to concentrate to use them, e.g.
 Infra-Vision or a reflexive Danger Sense vs.
 X-Ray vision that you have to deliberately turn on.
 A sense that's defined as an Automatic Defense could still be used as part
 of a Primary Rule justification for attacking something that would otherwise
 be invisible, but you'd still need some other Power to make the attack.

\begin_layout Standard
The Primary Rule of Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is that actions have to make sense in a SF kind of way.
 In order to justify using an Ability, you have to describe using the Ability
 in a way that makes sense...at least according to the genre conventions.
 Decisions as to whether that particular use of a Ability ought to be allowed
 rest with the player, though the GM or other players are permitted to point
 out if they think the player is pushing it; the GM is also encouraged to
 point out circumstances that the player ought to take into account when
 deciding how to use the Ability (such as the enemy currently hovering 300
 feet in the air, or holding a hostage in front of him), and it's ultimately
 up to the GM to decide on and describe the effect of using the Ability
 on the environment or the foes, as long as he does so in a way that doesn't
 countermand the player's description of the attempt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The player should stop short of describing the reaction, although saying
 what she's trying to do is fine: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I pick up a chair and hurl it at the alien
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I try to lasso the flying alien and pull it out of the air
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are good, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I pick up a chair and hurl it at the flying alien, knocking him out of the
 air and pinning him beneath it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 isn't as good.
 When describing your attempts you should leave room for either the dice
 or circumstances unknown to you to intervene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example: if the player wishes to hit the enemy using his Super Strength,
 even though the enemy is 300 feet in the air, he can announce that he grabs
 a nearby lamp-post and hurls it at the enemy.
 The GM can remind the player that they are currently in the desert, so
 maybe it should be a rock, and the GM can rule that the lamppost/rock passes
 through the enemy harmlessly (because unbeknown to the player at the moment,
 it's just a hologram), but the GM shouldn't override the player to say
 there are no lampposts, rocks, or anything else suitable to throw or that
 the throw falls short without giving the player a chance to roll to see
 if the Super Strength Power succeeds in overcoming the enemy's defense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the system it to make everything simple, fast, and exciting;
 negotiation every round between the players and the GM as to what's permissible
 and what objects are in the environment and whether any die-rolls are needed
 to see if the character can use them just slow things down and break the
 flow.
 In SF adventures there's always an object of the right size around to pick
 up and chuck if that's what the character wants to do.
 Similarly as long as the fight is taking place in an area where there are
 such things as fire hydrants or high-voltage lines, then they are assumed
 to be within reach and ready to be deployed with the appropriate Abilities.
 The players are entitled to make up such features of the environment as
 seem plausible as they go about describing their actions.

If you need to make a roll and you don't have an appropriate Ability according
 to the Primary Rule, you roll your Default Skill instead.
 This happens most often when your Defenses aren't applicable.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}

you never resist an attack with your bare Attribute, you always have some
 chance of mitigating the attack somehow.
 The Default Skill also represents using a skill implied by your Background

 that isn't one of your Powers, as well as using one of your Minor Powers.
 When using your Default Skill this way, roll PL 3 (a single d4) if there's
 any way of justifying it by your Background, and PL2 (a single d2) if you
 can't.
 Normal people will roll PL 3 (d4) in the areas that they're trained in,

\begin_layout Standard
When you roll for the result of an uncontested Ability, the result is always
 interpreted relative to the Scope of the character; even if two characters
 have Super Strength at PL 6, if one is Neighborhood Scope and the other
 is Global Scope the latter is able to lift much greater weights.

assumes that feats such as picking up crates, flying your fighter, or jumping
 from your hover-tank onto the enemy hover-tank are incidental to the action.
 Picking up a nearby car and hurling it at the enemy with your Super Strength
 isn't two actions, one of attempting to pick up the car and another of
 hitting the enemy with it; it's a single attack that happens to be narrated
 as using a convenient piece of scenery in accordance with the Primary Rule
 of sounding like an SF story.
 Chances are that the player taking the action invented the car being there
 for that purpose; it would make no mechanical difference if it had been
 a dumpster, mailbox, or just the character's fists, so there is no reason
 to interrupt and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait, can your character lift a car? Roll for it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The only reason to make an uncontested check is when there is both a reason
 to care about the outcome, and genuine doubt about whether the character
 is up to the task.
 For instance, if the enemy hurls a car and the character wants to try to
 catch it so that the passengers aren't injured it would be reasonable to
 check, and roll if it would be past the limit of what the Ability is normally
 capable of, such as using a PL 6 Ability at Neighborhood Scope to catch
 a medium-sized car.

\begin_layout Standard
The Difficulty for exerting your Abilities to accomplish

specific
\shape default
 effects appropriate to the Ability (such as using Super Strength to lift
 an object) is based off of the Power Levels for the Scope.
 The maximum die roll represents the

Chart 11.1 on the next page summarizes Difficulty 6 for each Scope (that
 is, what it would take a roll of 6 to do) to give you a quick idea, but
 you should see Appendix for a list of the effects for each Power Level
 and the real-world equivalents in weight and speed.
 Not every Ability or every use of a Ability will directly translate into
 weight or speed, and many characters will have at least some Abilities
 above the base but the charts give you a general feel for the order of
 magnitude that Abilities of a given level might represent.

\begin_layout Standard
E.g., Difficulty 6 at Regional Scope is equivalent in weight to a medium car
 (2 metric tons), so a character at that Scope with Ability like Super Strength
 or Telekinesis would roll her Ability against Difficulty 6 to lift the
 car.
 Obviously, if the character's Ability was PL 8 (d8, d8) this would be easier
 to do than if they were using a PL 6 (d6, d6) Ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say your character at the Neighborhood Scope wants to lift a medium car,
 weight 2 tons: that's a 9 referring to the chart in the Appendix.
 If you have Enhanced Strength PL 6 that will require hitting Difficulty
 9 on his d6, d6.
 You would need use some combination of Wild Shot, Supreme Effort

 achieve that.
 Supposing, though, that your Strength was at PL 10 (d10, d10), you would
 be able to do it without any special effort if you roll well.
 If you don't, you can change the roll to a success by paying a penalty
 (See Failure is Not an Option!) Remember, though, that if it's not important
 you shouldn't be rolling.

 For instance, a normal would have a PL 2 (d2), in her profession, an expert

 Tasks that should be easier than that for them ought not to require a roll

When you attack other characters, the defenders get to announce what they
 are doing to Defend themselves, which can include spending Actions on Active
 Powers to aid in their defense.
 The defenders need to remember how many Actions they use and which Active
 Powers they employ, so that when their Turns come around they don't re-use
 them.
 Remember, you can only use an Active Power once per turn, and it costs
 an Action to use any Active Power to defend yourself.
 If the defender's Turn was earlier in the Round, she can only use Active
 Powers to defend herself if she has both Actions and unused Powers remaining.

Most of the time, opposed rolls take place when one character is trying
 to damage another.
 If the attack is a success, subtract the defense roll from the attack roll:
 the result is the Damage.
 You then compare the Damage to the defender's appropriate score.
 For most attacks, that will be their Toughness; if you have an appropriate
 Advantage it might be compared to Will or Stamina instead.
 The possible results are the opponent are Hindered

 Overkill, or as one of the results of applying the Primary Rule, or something
 that happens once in a while but only as a result of the plot (as when

When you use a Power, there's a chance that you'll cause Collateral Damage.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SF battles are famous for the amount of destruction they wreak on the surroundin
gs.
 At the GM's discretion attacks made can be checked to see if they cause
 Collateral Damage.
 If you hit a foe with your fist, you probably won't cause Collateral Damage
 unless you knock him flying into something; if you hit a foe with a bus,
 at the very least the bus should suffer Collateral Damage and it's pretty
 likely you hit various people and nearby objects unless your target dwarfs
 the bus in size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GM's shouldn't slow the game down with checks for Collateral Damage after
 every single attack; save it for when it would make a difference, such
 as when the enemy is holding a hostage, or the battle is taking place on
 top of something important that could explode or collapse.
 Trivial damage, such as hot-dog stands getting knocked over, awnings being
 busted or car alarms going off, can simply be narrated as a result of the
 Primary Rule.
 Save actual checks for Collateral Damage for times when somebody will care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the result of the lower die from the roll as an attack against whatever
 near-by targets seem appropriate according to the Primary Rule; those targets
 then roll their appropriate defense or the Default Skill if they have none.
 If you're rolling only one die, such as when you are Hindered or taking
 a Wild Shot, if the GM calls for checking Collateral Damage at that point
 roll the second die and use the result even if it's higher than the original
 roll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM should assign Toughness to objects based on how reasonable it is
 for a character at that Scope to break the object; a rule-of-thumb is Toughness
 equal to the Scope that the object would usually appear.
 So a hot-dog stand would be Street Level (3), a car would be Neighborhood
 level (4), and so on.
 An Out result from a Power at or lower than the object's Scope will break
 the object and render it unusable until repaired; it requires Out from
 a Power at least one Scope higher in order to destroy the object, three
 higher if the the object is a building or collection of buildings.

 all your Abilities except Automatic Powers are reduced to a single (better)

 Hindered conditions accumulate if you keep getting attacked successfully,

\begin_layout Standard
Being Hindered represents some specific thing that happened to the character
 as a result of the successful attack that was insufficient to put the character
 Out.
 It could be becoming trapped beneath the thrown bus, having your hands

 by the force of the attack if no more specific thing suggests itself.
 The GM will generally describe what it is that's Hindering you, following
 from how the attack was described; go with it.
 If it's really impossible that your character be Hindered in the way described
 (the GM forgot that your character doesn't need to breath, so gasping from
 smoke won't do) then suggest something that does seem plausible to you.
 One way or another if the attack was justified under the Primary Rule and
 the result was high enough to Hinder you, you should be Hindered.

, melting your way out of webs, teleporting from beneath the rubble, and
 so on); it is this that costs an Action.
 Players should be more generous than usual in interpreting what is an appropria
te description for freeing yourself from being Hindered.
 Basically, being Hindered costs you an Action, it's not intended to cost
 you the rest of your Turn after you become Unhindered or debilitate the
 character for the rest of the fight; the presumption should be that somehow
 or other you can free yourself as long as you have Actions remaining.
 Using a Ability in your description of how you free yourself from being
 Hindered doesn't count as its single use for the Round.
 No matter how many Hindered tokens you have stacked on you, you can always
 clear them all by sacrificing your Turn (all your Actions) for the Round,
 or by sacrificing one point of Will (see Sheer Determination).

 This makes no real difference if your Ally is only Hindered once (you spend
 the Action instead of them doing it), but is substantially better if they
 have a lot of accumulated Hindered conditions such as when the enemies
 have attacked them over and over; as an ally you can clear off all the
 pesky agents with a single Action, while the character herself would have
 to either do it one by one, by sacrificing a Turn, or through Sheer Determinati

 Out does not have to literally mean unconscious, merely incapable of further

 If you had a Shtick that was specifically designed for bringing him back
 into the fight, such as Teleport Ally Shtick of your own, then you could
 do it with a single Action; note that it has to be a Shtick, rather than
 a regular Power.
 (This serves as a bonus for taking such specialized Shticks.)

\begin_layout Standard
Exactly how you are Out and what others would have to do to revive you from
 being Out will depend on the description of the attack that put you Out
 and the Primary Rule.
 For your part, there is nothing you can do to hurry the process of reviving,
 but it is assumed that after three of your Turns even if nobody has aided
 you as long as the battle hasn't ended you will have found a way out of
 it, through sheer force of will if nothing else.
 It's not at all unusual to be Out, perhaps more than once, during the course
 of a battle.
 Getting Out does not mean that you lose, unless you are the last character
 standing, and perhaps not even then depending on whether the enemy has
 the time and foresight to put you Down for the Count or flee; if the enemy
 is otherwise occupied setting bombs, hijacking the airwaves to deliver
 his demands or chasing off the police then you will be back in action in
 three Turns.
 SF battles are full of reversals and comebacks from near-certain defeat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the Primary Rule justification, Out must be reversible; you
 are not allowed to define powers such that Out with the power is permanent.
 Even if the Out character is magically turned to stone, the result must
 be temporary.
 (Optionally in a gritty campaign, you may agree that Overkill can make
 Out permanent, barring some extraordinary plot event.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optional Rule: Injury
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Injury"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the Tone for the campaign, serious, or at least long-lasting
 injury may be more or less common.
 In some settings, wounds never last past an episode, in others, characters
 may find themselves having to deal with long-term effects of injury or
 even lose an eye or a hand...perhaps to replace it at a later date with a
 cyborg implant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon returning from Out, whether you were helped or not, there is a chance
 that you suffered a more serious injury.
 If the Primary Rule reason you were out was such that it could have wounded
 you, rather than just entangled you or put you to sleep, roll the unskilled
 Default PL 2 (d2).
 On a roll of a 1, you are Tired, and gain a new Complication to reflect
 the ongoing injury.
 For instance, you might decide that your left hand is useless and in a
 sling.
 You may decide for yourself whether the Complication is Major or Minor,
 depending on how it was acquired.
 Like normal Complications you may substitute a new Complication for this
 one when you choose to, say by replacing the hand with a prosthetic.
 To remove the Complication completely you must spend a Boost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equipment such as Armor and certain Powers allow you to mitigate the chance
 of injury; you may substitute the Armor roll for your untrained Default
 if you were wearing armor that could have mitigated the damage.
 For instance if you were Out from a shot by a Blaster, then wearing Trooper
 armor would let you roll a d6 instead of a d2, and only if you rolled a
 1 on the d6 would you suffer injury.
 On the other hand if you were Out from a Psionic attack, the same Trooper
 armor wouldn't be any use.
 If you have a Power or Shtick that's directly on point, such as Regeneration,
 then you may substitute the Power's larger die instead.
\end_layout

Restraining
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can automatically Counter an Out character recovering from being Out
 by Restraining him.
 Restraining requires spending an Action with an appropriate Primary Rule
 justification, such as tying the Out character up, burying him under some
 rubble, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A character that's being Restrained can't return to the battle without outside
 help: another character will have to Hinder
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hindered!Restraining
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or put the character who's Restraining him Out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as you are continue to spend an Action every Round to Restrain the
 character, nobody can bring him back from Out status, nor does the three
 Turn limit apply.
 If you stop Restraining him, whether voluntarily, or because somebody has
 put you Out or Hindered you, he is still Out until one of the conditions
 for reviving him is met.
 The three Turn count runs concurrently with being Restrained, so if three
 of his Turns or more have passed while he was Restrained, he is no longer
 Out and may act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether minions and bystanders, individually or taken together as a Mob,
 are capable of restraining a character who's been Out depends on the character
 and the Primary Rule justification they're using.
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can choose to spend an entire turn, all of your Actions and no Movement
 allowed, putting an Out character Down For the Count.
 If you are attacked during the turn, even if the attack fails, you do not
 make progress putting him Down for the Count and have to try again.
 You still need a Primary Rule justification for him being Down for the
 Count, such as wrapping a steel I-beam around the character, cocooning
 him in webbing from head to toe, or simply winding up a hay-maker and knocking
 the living daylights out of him.
 Characters that are Down for the Count are out of action until the end
 of combat, no matter how many Rounds that takes, unless they are revived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with Restraining, you can't put a character Down For The Count that you
 couldn't Hinder
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hindered!Down for the Count
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the first place: if the Power you're trying to use to put the Out character
 Down For The Count is incapable of at least Hindering the character (e.g.
 the maximum your Power can roll is 10 and the minimum their Automatic Defense
 can roll is 11), then you need to use a Power with a higher Power Level
 or Combine Powers with other characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a gritty campaign, Down For the Count may mean dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Down for the Count is reversible, assuming the character is not dead (and
 in some campaigns, even if the character is dead); bringing a character
 back from Down For the Count requires the same effort (all Actions) as
 putting a character Down For the Count, as well as a Primary Rule justification
, which might be harder to come by than normal.

 dramatic reversals and come-from-behind victories, and Zap!

 Like Hindered
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

, while you are Tired you only roll one die for your Abilities.
 Unlike Hindered, being Tired doesn't accumulate: you are either Tired or
 you are not.
 Tiredness does not stack with being Hindered, though you don't get your
 full dice back until both conditions are cleared.
 You cease to be Tired when:
\end_layout

 if you're using a Power withe the Control Advantage) but it means the target
 is temporarily bent to your will.
 If you were firing your weapon at them trying to get them to take cover,
 they take cover.
 If you were trying to Intimidate them into running, they run.
 If you were trying to fast talk your way past the guards, they let you
 through.
 They can still rally later, under much the same circumstances as somebody
 recovering from being Out from an attack on Toughness, e.g.
 Aid from an Ally with an appropriate Ability, or after 3 turns.

\begin_layout Standard
When you do more than

 The exact result of Overkill will depend on the tone of the campaign.
 Whether it occurs or not is entirely the GM's option, and it might result
 in the foe being out for the remainder of combat, a serious injury, or
 even death.
 Whether Overkill can ever result in death is something that should be agreed
 upon by the group before the rule is ever invoked to inflict it.
 Nothing can kill the fun of a campaign faster than when a player suddenly
 finds that manslaughter is possible, and she has committed it.
 You should always make sure the players know if Overkill can result in
 death, and that they can and should be using Careful Aim or Pulled Punches
 if they want to be sure of avoiding it.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a character announces an Action they plan to do, other characters may
 decide to Counter the Action.
 For example, if the Mad Genius is about to press the self-destruct button
 for the base, your character may want to tackle him before he can do so.
 Or you may want to stop an alien beast from biting your friend by attracting
 its attention to yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a character announces an Action that you wish to Counter, you can spend
 one of your Actions and specify a Power, Shtick or the Default Skill to
 use to try to prevent them from taking that Action.
 Whatever they're attempting to do must now beat you in an Opposed Task
 first.
 (Naturally you have to have Actions remaining and be using a Power that
 you haven't already used this Round.) Combined Abilities and other rules
 apply to this Opposed Task as normal.
 If he wins, he goes ahead with his Action as planned and this contest doesn't
 count as his one use of that Power for the turn; if he loses then he's
 out the Power and the Action and his attempt failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the character being Countered wishes, he can concede the contest and
 re-use his Power and Action to do something completely different instead;
 the Counterer will still have spent the Action and the Power.
 E.g.
 you try to Counter the beast's attack on your friend by distracting him
 with your Acrobatics, leaping and dancing about; the beast concedes the
 contest, but turns and uses his Action and his Bite power to try to chomp
 you instead; you've still spent your Action and used your Power, so you'll
 need to defend with something else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The character being Countered also has the option of trying to bring a different
 power to bear to overcome your Countering; this will cost him another Action
 and use another Power in addition to whatever he was using for the attempt
 itself.
 Most of the time this will be because he was using his Default Skill in
 the attempt, rather than a Power.
 E.g.
 the Mad Genius was going to push the button, which would be an ordinary
 task with his Default Skill since he has no particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Button Pushing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Power.
 If you attempt to Counter him using your Klangon Strength, you'll almost
 certainly succeed; to prevent that he employs his Mind Control Helmet to
 try to divert your strength.
 This costs him an extra Action and uses his Power, but the Opposed Task
 is now between his Mind Control Helmet and your Klangon Strength, which
 he at least has a chance of winning.
 If he wins, he proceeds; if he loses, he's out 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 Abilities and Actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An ally may attempt to oppose the counter for you.
 The classic example is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covering fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: Ace Astra wants to run across the deck to get to the emergency shut-off
 button on the docking bay force-field; the enemy Troopers announce they
 are Countering by laying down heavy suppressive fire with their Blaster
 Rifles vs.
 her (Default) running ability; her ally Ford the bounty-hunter opposes
 the Countering by firing 
\emph on
his
\emph default
 Blaster Rifle as covering fire.
 The Trooper's Counter roll is now vs.
 Ford's Blaster Rifle ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that even if you use an attack power like Wrestling to Counter an Action
 and succeed, the Countered character isn't Hindered or damaged in any way.
 Your Wrestling hold lasted long enough that they couldn't press the red
 button this turn, but does not continue to disrupt their activities.

 In addition, Players should take particular care that the Primary Rule

The opposite of Combining Abilities is Splitting Abilities: you can choose
 to attack multiple targets at once by dividing up your Power into two dice,
 one at each target, or attempt two tasks at once by dividing up your Shtick.
 You can't Split Abilities that have been reduced to one die, such as when
 Hindered or Tired.
 As usual, you need to follow the Primary Rule by having a plausible explanation
 for what you're doing, whether it's firing one gun with either hand at
 different targets, or kicking one guy while punching another.
 Even if your explanation of how you're splitting your power involves multiple
 shots, it still only counts as one Action.
 Similarly, you need a good explanation of how you're using your Shtick
 in multiple ways at once, such as trying to use your Thief Shtick to remain
 hidden in shadows while picking the lock: one die would go towards the
 hiding in shadows, the other towards picking the lock.

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to allow crazier stunts, such as stomping the ground so hard
 it bowls over an entire squad, or running around at super speed punching
 a dozen guys in the face, you can use the Impromptu Area Effect Rule to
 break up the dice to cover even more targets.
 Attacking two targets uses one die each.
 After that each time you lower the die-size by one, you double the number
 of targets that die effects (e.g., d8, d8 becomes 1d8 on each, then 1d6 on
 2 targets and 1d6 on another 2, then 1d4 on 4 targets and another 1d4 on
 a different 4 targets, etc.).
 You can never split a Power below d4, and you can never 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

double up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by having the two groups overlap by a single target; if that means that
 you cover less than the maximum (say there are 4 in one group and only
 3 left over for the second group), them's the breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, Impromptu Area Effect is intended for when somebody is spreading
 their Power around, such as setting your Maser on wide-angle to try to
 shoot an entire crowd, or when the gigantic lizard sweeps its tail through
 the entire party.
 If you're doing something like shooting a hole in a nearby coolant pipe
 with your blaster to try to engulf a mass of Empire Troopers, or tossing
 a tapestry down on a group of guards charging up the stairs at you, it's
 quicker and easier for the GM to treat that as creating a Peril or Obstacle
 instead.

When you're using Impromptu Area Effect, after you've split the dice to

When rolling for a bunch of identical Abilities, such as when NPCs are defending

 Impromptu Area Effect, instead of rolling for each individual roll the
 defensive Power and treat the high die as applying to half the group, and
 the low die as applying to the other half.

A Note on Tactics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you are fighting a group of identical foes, such as agents, and you don't
 really care which one you put Out, it is always advantageous to at least
 split your Power into two attacks.
 E.g., if you have a d10, d10 attack, make it d10 against each of two foes.
 If the resulting roll is too low to affect the agents on both dice, rolling
 both against a single agent wouldn't have helped; if one of the dice is
 high enough and the other isn't, you still put an agent Out just as if
 you'd rolled against a single agent; if both of the dice roll high enough,
 you manage to get two agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Contrariwise, if you are fighting a single foe, or you have reason to care
 exactly which foe you're putting down (such as the one who is closest to
 the launch button in the underground missile silo), it's better to use
 both dice against that single foe, and even better if you can Combine Actions
 to use larger dice.
 Wild Shot (merging two dice into a single larger die) is a toss-up: it's
 more random, so your average roll will be lower, but the maximum roll will
 be higher.
 If you think the average is good enough to prevail you should stick to
 rolling two dice; if you think that you'll only win if you roll close to
 the max then you should Wild Shot.

The duration of the effects of various Abilities should generally be determined
 by the Primary Rule.
 If you make a patch of ice with one of your Abilities, it will last until
 somebody else uses a Power to get rid of it, or it melts naturally.
 If you make a wall of stone, it will last until indefinitely, or until
 it's destroyed.
 On the other hand, many Power effects should be presumed to last only until
 they're overcome; if you Hinder a foe by trying to encase him in ice, the
 icy coating only lasts until he spends an Action to free himself.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are times when the character may want to be more cautious about using
 attacks, either to be surer that you hit, or to avoid doing Collateral
 Damage or Overkill.
 If you take Careful Aim then instead of rolling the dice you take half
 the die size of the larger die.
 E.g., on d6, d6 you take 3, on d10, d8 you take 5.
 You won't have the chance of rolling really well, but you won't roll really
 poorly either.
 You cannot use this option while you are Hindered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use Careful Aim, then you can choose not to do any Collateral Damage
 if you wish.
 An exception is when you are attacking a bunch of targets at once, either
 via a Power with the Area Effect advantage or by Splitting the Dice; in
 that case, whether you can avoid Collateral Damage through Careful Aim
 depends on the Primary Rule justification you're using to explain how you
 manage to hit all the targets.
 For instance, a character using Super Speed could say that he's just running
 up to each target and punching them individually in the nose, so avoiding
 Collateral Damage makes perfect sense; a character using Super Strength
 who's justifying Splitting the Dice among a number of henchmen who are
 standing within a crowd of bystanders by picking up a bus and throwing
 it at them can take Careful Aim to make sure that he hits them (doing half
 the die-size), but can't reasonably aim so as to hit only the henchmen
 and not the people they're standing among; a character with a Rain of Fire
 Power that has the Area Effect advantage is similarly unable to avoid Collatera
l Damage simply by choosing to use Careful Aim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish, you may also declare that you're Pulling Your Punch and then
 you won't cause Overkill even if the result would normally be sufficient
 to Overkill; you cannot Pull your Punch unless you are taking Careful Aim.
 Again, Pulling Your Punch may require extra justification, particularly
 if you're using an Area Effect attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Careful Aim and Pulling Punches cannot be combined with Wild Shot, since
 the nature of Wild Shot is giving it everything you've got instead of taking
 a safer more controlled shot.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are trying an Uncontested action and you roll poorly, you can adjust
 the roll into the maximum roll by spending another Action and invoking
 Failure Is Not An Option! You should accompany this with some explanation
 of how you managed to pull it off.
 If you were in combat, you become Hindered; this represents some extra
 time or effort you needed to put in to change the failure to a success.
 If the adjustment is more than your Stamina, you're Tired in addition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're out of Actions, you may still invoke Failure Is Not An Option
 but you automatically become tired, no matter how small the adjustment
 was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g., you are attempting to lift a car off the train tracks before the oncoming
 train barrels into it, at Difficulty 6 for your Scope; if you roll less
 than a 6, you can choose to still lift the car if you wish, but you narrate
 that it almost slipped out of your grip (the bad roll), and you had to
 lunge for it, as a result you're Hindered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For extended tasks outside of combat where it doesn't make much sense that
 you are temporarily Hindered, you may adjust still the roll to the maximum,
 but if the adjustment is more than your Stamina you become Tired; this
 represents working really hard at the task, such as might be represented
 in a movie or comic book by a montage: exhaustive searches at the library,
 late nights at the lab, pounding the streets talking to contacts, and so
 on, until you succeeded.
\end_layout

You may never do this with Contested rolls; instead you would use Supreme

\begin_layout Standard
One staple of SF stories is the characters are often able to Intimidate
 others through a display of their Abilities, particularly much weaker foes
 such as normal people or low-level thugs.
 Attempts to Intimidate are treated as attacks vs.
 Will, but instead of being a contested roll against the Power that would
 normally be used to defend against such an attack, the contest is vs.
 the defender's strongest Power.
 This is the

 principle.
 Attempts to Intimidate don't literally require an attack on the defender,
 merely a demonstration of what the Power is capable of, such as against
 a nearby inanimate object.
 Creative use of the Primary Rule can justify using Powers such as movement
 or defenses in Intimidation, e.g.
 by using flight or telekinesis to dangle somebody high above the ground,
 or to demonstrate that the target's best weapons bounce harmlessly off
 your powered armor.

If you are Tired, you can expend 1 point of Stamina to recover from being

 A rest scene really should involve a restful activity, like spending a

 If the Power isn't sufficiently strong, but is close, you may attempt a
 Supreme Effort to accomplish the task anyway.
 You add your Will Attribute to the roll.
 E.g., d6, d6 Power plus Will 3 rolls 5, 2, which is a 5, then + 3 for the
 Supreme Effort = 8 total.
 If the roll is Uncontested you may combine this with Failure is Not an
 Option (becoming Hindered as well, to change your roll to the highest possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you make a Supreme Effort, your Stamina goes down by one temporarily

 Once you become Tired, you may not attempt further Supreme Effort until
 you recover from being Tired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may apply Supreme Effort 
\shape italic
after

 you see what the die roll is by spending an additional Action.
 This simulates the comic book trope of realizing that you're about to fail
 and redoubling your effort, even when that effort is something like firing
 eye-beams.
 If instead you choose to apply Supreme Effort before the role it doesn't
 take an extra Action, but might well be wasted (if the roll is so bad that
 Supreme Effort can't possibly help, or so good that it was not needed).

 Rounds, such as radioactive goo spreading across the floor from the storage

 control, countdown timers on doomsday devices advancing, and so on.
 Play should then alternate between a player taking a Turn and then the
 GM taking the Turn of one or more NPCs, until every PC and NPC has taken
 a Turn.
 The GM should try to space out the Turns of the NPCs so they go in between
 each player's Turn, instead of all the NPCs at once.

The variety of Abilities and situations that science fiction characters
 confront, and all the ways they can combine, is vast.
 Most of the time, dealing with this in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is straightforward: you apply the Primary Rule to see what sounds sensible
 in an SF story and then either it simply happens (if it's unopposed and
 well within the Ability's capabilities), you roll and compare to a Difficulty
 (if it's unopposed but possibly beyond the limits of the Ability), or you
 roll against the opposing Ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, some special situations crop up frequently enough that it's
 worth treating them slightly differently, both for greater fidelity to
 the genre and more consistency when they crop up.
 They are largely elaborations on the basic procedure, rather than replacements
 for it, and the GM should feel free to ignore them in any situations where
 they would make less sense than the basic procedure.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SF characters frequently confront mobs, even armies, of lesser foes.
 While the ordinary rules for combining Abilities (when it comes to the
 mob attacking) and splitting Abilities (when the characters attack the
 mob) are sufficient for small groups, it can become tedious if the mob
 is very large or is interacting with multiple characters at once.
 In these situations, it's convenient to handle the mob as a single entity,
 or perhaps one entity per character.
 Simply stat the mob out as if it were a enemy, with Abilities and Attributes
 representing the combined values of the individual members; there is no
 need to calculate this according to the rules for Combining Abilities,
 just do it directly based on the Scope.
 E.g., a mob of ordinary citizens sufficient to take on a Neighborhood-level
 character can just be given a Main Power (guns and improvised weapons)
 at Level 6 (d6, d6), a Automatic Defense (multiple bodies) at Level 8 (d8,
 d8), Toughness 3, Will, Stamina and Actions 2, and then fight as a single
 entity.
 Out can represent the mob being dispersed, rather than each individual
 being incapacitated (though it could represent that, too, depending on
 the Primary Rule).
 When fighting a mob as a single entity, there is no need for characters
 to split their Abilities or use Area Effect Abilities to cover the entire
 mob, whether making an ordinary attack or Intimidation; the presumption
 is that the coordination or tight packing that allows the mob to be treated
 as a single entity for purposes of overwhelming the characters render it
 vulnerable to disruption or scattering without special effort on the part
 of the characters so long as the basics of the Primary Rule are followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mobs are treated the same as single characters when it comes to rules like
 Wild Shot, Supreme Effort, and the like, whether the mob is fighting a
 single character or another mob.
 Mobs may Combine Actions with characters, provided they are operating at
 the same Scope.
 That is, a single minion shouldn't be able to combine with the enemy leader
 to give him a bonus, but a mob of minions large enough to be a threat to
 the character should.

Hit Locations

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Most of the time the exact location a blow or shot hits can be determined
 according to the Primary Rule, or just by picking a likely location.
 Sometimes you might want a way to resolve where it lands in an impartial
 fashion: perhaps the attack does something additional if it hits unarmored
 skin, or perhaps you just find it easier if you don't have to make it up
 on the fly.
 Chart 15.1 can be used to pick a location without any additional roll.
 Just use the least-significant digit of the lower of the two dice rolled.
 The smaller the die, the larger the area the number represents: on a d4,
 a 3 would be anywhere on the arm or hand; on a d6 a 3 would be on the forearm
 or hand.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adventurers sometimes face opponents of different Scopes from their own,
 whether it's lower-level alien critters or menaces from a higher Scope.
 Since within a Scope Power levels always have the same range from PL 2
 to PL 12 (roughly), when encountering something from another Scope you
 have to translate its Scope to your own.
 You should almost always translate them into your Scope, so you don't have
 to do the math on all the players' Abilities.
 To do that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each Scope Level the opponent is 
\emph on
higher
\emph default
, add 1 to its Power Level for PLs less than 6, add 2 to its PL for PLs
 greater than or equal to 6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each Scope Level the opponent is 
\emph on
lower
\emph default
, subtract 2 from its Power Level for PLs greater than or equal to 6, subtract
 1 from its Power Level for PLs less than 6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Facing a foe 2 Scope Levels lower (such as Street Scope when you are City)
 who has a PL 7 Power : Street Level 7 = Neighborhood Level 5 = City Level
 4.
 The first jump in Scope subtracts 2, the second only 1, since at that point
 it's already at less than 6.
 His Power will be treated as PL 4 when facing you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Facing a foe 3 Scope Levels higher (such as Regional Level when you are
 Street) who has a PL 7 Power: Regional 7 = City 9 = Neighborhood 11 = Street
 13.
 Each downward jump add 2 levels.
 His PL 7 Power will be treated as PL 13 (d8+5, d12) while at your Scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Facing a foe 3 Scope Levels higher who has a PL 4 Power: Regional 4 = City
 5 = Neighborhood 6 = Street 8.
 The first two downward jumps add only 1, since the PL is less than 6, then
 the last adds 2.
 His Power at your Scope is PL 8.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you look at the Power Level charts in the Appendix you'll see this is
 a reasonably good approximation of looking up what a Power at a given Scope
 ought to be able to do and then cross-indexing to what the equivalent is
 on the Scope chart for the appropriate lower or higher Scope.

\begin_layout Section
Inventing Features of the Environment, How Much is Too Much?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

leaves the players a good deal of room to just make up features of the environme
nt as needed to employ their Abilities.
 If they're in a docking bay and they want to hurl a barrel at an oncoming
 trooper, they can assume there's a barrel because that seems plausible.
 Nothing is really gained by forcing them to stop and ask the GM whether
 there is a barrel, and if not is there something similar enough that it
 would work within reach? On the other hand, it would be very dull if the
 players could just declare 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I pick up the secret documents we're supposed to be searching for from where
 they were left in the open on the desk.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Similarly, if the characters are in a starport bar, the players can just
 assume that there are bartenders and patrons such as a loud drunk, a prosperous
-looking businessman (unless perhaps it was a very seedy bar), a tough-looking
 stevedore, and so on...
 but what about the President of the Federation, who just happens to be
 there? Where to draw the line?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rule of thumb is that players should refrain from inventing anything
 that would demand further explanation.
 If you were watching an SF show and there were barrels in the docking bay,
 it would never occur to you to wonder why they were there, but if the heroes
 stumbled across the secret plans just lying on a receptionist's desk it
 would raise all kinds of questions.
 Players should try to never just make something up that makes the other
 players stop and wonder how or why it's there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if something were perfectly plausible, the players shouldn't invent
 it on their own if it would raise questions about why nobody noticed it
 before.
 You don't want to have your narration cause all the other players to have
 to completely revise their mental image of the scene.
 A bar-fight may be a perfectly normal occurence, at least in the kind of
 bar PC's frequent...
 but a player ought not declare that her character is using the distraction
 caused by the heretofore unmentioned bar-fight going on to pick somebody's
 pocket since that would raise the question of why nobody noticed it until
 now.
 Better to instigate a fight, and 
\emph on
then
\emph default
 use it as a distraction.

Range and positioning in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}

are highly abstract, and are scaled according to the Personal Scope of the
 Campaign.
 Rather than giving a range as a concrete number such as 300 meters, and
 then calculating that based on a movement rate of 100 meters per Round
 it will take three Rounds to cover the distance, in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you would say that since the Scope is e.g., Neighborhood, the enemy being
 on the next street over puts him at Pursuit Range, and it will take one
 round using your Movement Power to reduce that to Combat Range.
 Almost all combat takes place at Combat Range for the Scope, except perhaps
 at the beginning when the sides are just catching sight of each other,
 or if one side is trying to elude the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Range divides into Combat Range, Pursuit Range, and Lost Contact with the
 distances depending on the Scope.
 Combat Ranges for each Scope are listed below; Pursuit Range is one Scope
 level higher, and Lost Contact is two Scope levels higher.
 So a character operating at City Scope would treat everything in a single
 block of buildings as within Combat Range, up to a couple blocks away in
 any direction as being Pursuit Range, anything farther away would be Lost
 Contact.
 Note that Pursuit Range doesn't literally mean they are directly visible
 at all times, or that you have noticed them, merely that the Scope of your
 senses and movement Abilities are sufficient that you can attempt to locate
 them; depending on the Primary Rule that may mean you are criss-crossing
 the area at Super Speed rather than searching for them with X-Ray vision,
 but in any case they must win one more Contested Movement roll before they've
 eluded you completely.

At Combat Range all Abilities work normally; at Pursuit Range, the you can
 only roll a Contest of either movement vs.
 movement or sensory Abilities versus hiding or evasion; if you've Lost
 Contact, you can't even try to locate the target any more—you have no idea
 which direction they've gone or how far.
 What constitutes Combat Range does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 depend on the Power in question: claws and laser-beam eyes have the exact
 same Combat Range for a given Scope, they simply require different descriptions
 of how the power is used to justify them, with claws more likely to require
 extra justification by including a description of how the character runs
 and leaps on the foe, or slashes a cable holding a cargo net to make it
 fall on him.
 In any case, by the Primary Rule if you can't come up with a plausible
 justification given the circumstances, you should refrain from using the
 power until it is justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Round you can try to reduce or increase the Range by one category;
 if the other side tries to prevent that from happening (by fleeing or pursuing)
 make a Contested roll of Movement and sensory Abilities vs.
 Movement and stealth Abilities, depending on whether the quarry is trying
 to outdistance pursuit or hide; this takes an Action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ranges are symmetric: no character can attack another from a range too great
 for the target to counter-attack.
 It may be that the description of certain Abilities implies a limitation
 on the range of that Power, e.g., a Sword implies that you generally have
 to be within arm's length of the target.
 Even so, if the character chooses to throw the sword, or move to close
 with the foe and smack him one, the range to the foe is no different from
 any other Power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Combat Range also determines the Difficulty of spotting a target with
 a sensory power, e.g.
 something that would require special senses to spot would ordinarily be
 Difficulty 6 , but for a Neighborhood Scope character to spot it several
 blocks away would be +2 Scope levels, therefor Difficulty 8.

Most Adventurers, except at the very lowest Personal Scopes, are capable
 of traveling much faster than would ever be necessary to get about in combat
 or reach any place within Combat Range within a relatively short amount
 of time.
 You can use the Power Level chart to figure out how fast your character
 can go, but most of the time the character is going to be more constrained
 by the need to justify the movement by the Primary Rule than the actual
 speed.
 Characters in Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

are presumed to be within reach of each others' Abilities as long as they're
 at Combat Range or less, as long as they describe what they're doing adequately.
 Movement is only separate action when you're attempting to change the Range
 or overcome an Obstacle, otherwise it takes place as part of the description
 of the other actions the character is taking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, if your Movement Power is Super Speed, and the enemy is flying,
 how do you get up to him if that's what you want to do? Can you run so
 fast that you can run straight up a near-by building? Or spin so fast with
 your arms outstretched that you helicopter into the air? Or do you need
 to find or build a ramp at super-speed and launch yourself off it? In real-worl
d physics there is no speed that makes any of those except the last possible,
 but in comic-book physics any could be an explanation if that's how you
 say your Power works, pretty much regardless of the exact level of the
 Power and where it falls on the speed chart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once in a while the situation might make it hard to justify using the Power:
 if the enemy is standing at the other side of a lava-filled crevasse and
 the character's Movement power is roller-skating the player might feel
 it's implausible that the character could jump the crevasse to touch the
 enemy with her stun glove; according to the Primary Rule she should simply
 do something else, or combine her attack with another character who can
 supply the needed justification by carrying her over to attack with his
 Rocket Pack power.
 In general, though, given the flexibility of Abilities and the leeway given
 to the players to invent plausible details of the environment such as vines
 to swing on, news copters to hitch a temporary ride from, rubble that's
 formed a convenient ramp to jump a motorcycle from, and so on, players
 should rarely find themselves at a loss for justifying closing any distance
 within Combat Range even if the Power's description requires they actually
 touch their opponent.

Difficulty for spotting something with your senses is relative to how hard
 it would be to spot, adjusted by distance according to the area that the
 particular Combat Range covers.
 By the Primary Rule, though, you should only have to roll if what you're
 trying to spot might easily be missed, such as when it's concealed or you're
 distracted.
 If it's actively trying to hide, that would be an Opposed check vs.
 whatever Ability it was using to conceal itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g., Something that an ordinary human could spot would be Difficulty 4, something
 only perceptible to super-senses or equivalent instruments would be difficulty
 6, and so on.
 (See Difficulty for Other Tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:DifficultyForOtherTasks"

\end_inset

).
 If an ordinary human could spot it when within the same large room (Scope
 2), then spotting it from the next block over (Scope 5) would be +3 to
 the difficulty, or Difficulty 7.
 On the other hand, spotting it from within the area covered by small room
 would be -1 to the difficulty, for a Difficulty of 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount that you make the roll by can be used to indicate how much informatio

 Succeeding by 0 means you can perceive what's currently happening, which
 is usually sufficient, but many unusual senses that Adventurers might possess
 could plausibly be able to reconstruct past events or perceive minute or
 subtle details.

Frequently in Science Fiction, the characters will be facing the unknown.
 It could be as prosaic as trying to solve a crime, or as exotic as trying
 to determine why the laws of physics themselves seem to be breaking down,
 but Investigation will form a large part of most SF adventures, and the
 players will want to play out obtaining new information.
 Most of the time in Zap!, the information is there for the asking, while
 the interpretation is left up to the players.
 If they search a body, or a database, or perform a scientific experiment,
 they will find everything that the GM thinks is a relevant clue, and perhaps
 some red herrings besides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other cases, the players will want their characters to perform investigations
 and detective work in order to outsmart or get the jump on the enemies,
 for instance to figure out their enemy's likely next move or sniff out
 the security precautions he's placed in his lair, in which case the character
 should roll the appropriate Ability (usually a Shtick) or the Default Skill
 if using something from the character's Background

\begin_layout Standard
You can Combine Actions for Abilities that give information, with yourself
 and others, and that usually is an excellent strategy since each additional
 success more than doubles the amount of information you get.
 (One roll at +1 is better than two characters making rolls.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that how much information you get is determined by the roll, but which
 information you get is determined by how you narrate your actions and phrase
 questions to the GM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is approximately how much information the GM should divulge.
 For instance if the detective is trying to deduce what the criminal's target
 is as they are attacking a museum exhibition, that's something that an
 ordinary person could do (Difficulty 4), so the detective rolls her appropriate
 Ability vs.
 Difficulty 4.
 Suppose she gets a 6; she beat it by 2 and the GM should provide about
 one sentence worth of information: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The most likely target is the special exhibition of gold insects on the
 second floor.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If she had beat it by 5, then the result would be a picture; not necessarily
 a literal picture, but the information equivalent to looking at a photo
 of what they intend to steal, which means that she could ask questions
 if she wanted such as what kind of display case it's in, whether there
 are guards around and so forth and the GM should try to answer if it would
 be evident from looking at such a photo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the GM is conveying the results of the Investigation roll, it's best
 if at all possible to give the actual clues that the detective spotted
 that lead to the conclusion couched in terms that make sense according
 to exactly what Ability or skill the detective is employing rather than
 the bare bones of the information.
 If a mystic character is using her Psychic Sensitivity to try to identify
 a suspect, then the description should be in terms of psychic impressions,
 and perhaps lean more heavily towards the feelings and psychology of the
 target; a character using Detective should be given more concrete physical
 description along the lines of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

From the angle of the blow it would have to be somebody taller than the
 victim, and quite strong, either a man or strong woman; the attacker was
 left-handed, and some from some thread that were caught on one of the victim's
 buttons was wearing a very expensive cashmere jacket.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The goal, as always with Zap!, is to make the descriptions flow satisfyingly
 from the Primary Rule being applied to the specific Ability used.

\begin_layout Standard
Don't overuse Investigation; in particular don't turn it into the skill
 system that Zap!
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

doesn't have.
 Nothing of value is added to the game by substituting Investigation rolls
 for the Spot and Notice checks that some other games have.
 If it's something that the character should notice or know because of their
 Abilities or Background
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Background
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the GM should just divulge the information.
 Characters in SF don't usually miss clues, even really obscure ones, and
 the flow of the game isn't helped by the players having to play twenty
 questions to see if they notice something relevant.
 SF characters in particular often have abilities far beyond those of mortal
 men, and even senses that nobody has or can accurately describe.
 Just go ahead and tell them all the information they can glean, using whatever
 senses and abilities they have, and let them get on with the far more interesti
ng part of interpreting and using that information.
 Reserve Investigation for when it's an activity that will be interesting
 enough to devote play time to, preferably when the players instigate it,
 for instance by announcing they're going to use their ship's computer to
 try to analyze the signal from the surface of the planet and identify the
 culture that likely produced it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can take some work for GMs used to other systems to shake the habit of
 asking the players to roll to see if anybody knows a certain piece of informati
on or notices the impending ambush, but it will make for a faster-paced
 game and help the characters really shine.
 A good rule of thumb is never use an Investigation roll for something that
 the character would passively notice or could see at a glance, and if the
 player announces the character is going to perform a specific activity
 to try to gather information such as visit the dives around the starport
 to shake down punks for information, or research at the university library,
 consider whether the Primary Rule implies they should just be given the
 information they're seeking (if it is indeed a plausible way to turn it
 up) without requiring a roll.
 Reserve rolling for situations where it's unclear whether and how much
 information they should turn up.

\begin_layout Standard
Negotiations are a catch-all for all inter-personal interaction that is
 not overtly hostile.
 Usually, you want something from someone else, and are trying to convince
 them to give it to you, whether you want a possession, information, or
 simply for them not to help your enemies.

 be known to be true, a lie, a conjecture, or a wild speculation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Entice/Caution: you are trying to make a certain course of action more appealing
 or more frightening.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using a Shtick in negotiations, set the difficulty level to be the
 Scope of the person or group you are negotiating with (for a person that's
 usually the size of the area they command, e.g.
 the Mayor of a City would be 5, since City is Scope 5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM will determine the most likely attitude at the start of the Scene
 based on your common history, alignment of interests, characters, and the
 role-played interaction.
 You can make a roll to Charm or Appease.
 Success improves their attitude by one level just during the scene; success
 by more than their Will makes the attitude one level higher permanently,
 or at least until you do something further that alters it for the worse;
 if you succeed by 
\series bold
3
\series default
 more than their Will, their attitude becomes 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 levels higher.
 If you 
\emph on
fail
\emph default
 by more than 
\series bold
3
\series default
, their attitude becomes one level 
\emph on
worse
\emph default
.
 You may not attempt to Charm/Appease them more than once per Scene, nor
 have different characters try one after another, although you may all Combine
 your abilities; once you've determined their basic attitude towards you
 for the scene and done your best to modify it, play out the rest of the
 scene and any attempts to Convince or Entice/Caution them based on the
 resulting attitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numbers for each attitude are modifiers to your rolls to Convince or
 Entice/Caution them, once you've determined their attitude.

\begin_layout Standard
It is generally cheap for a party to give you information they have, so
 any favorable attitude might give you information.
 Secondly, the other group may give you assistance.
 This will often be in the form of assigning an underling to help you, or
 a temporary Ability.
 They could also take charge of some aspect of a group plan, such as keeping
 the Imperial Troopers busy while you corner the General.
 Finally, if they are really committed to helping you, they could devote
 their entire resources to your joint endeavor.
 Usually, they would take charge of the major aspects and risks, and delegate
 some smaller role to you.

 the Primary Rule when taking their actions.
 It's not necessary to be obsessively detailed, and a battle mat and miniatures
 are almost certainly overkill (though if you want to and have the action
 figures lying around, go for it), but a bit of extra time fleshing out
 the scene slightly is well worth it.
 Don't just say

When you blast through the door, you see a hi-tech lab and a bunch of technician
s.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If you can, add some salient details: Along the right side of the room
 are a bunch of bubbling tanks with shadowy figures suspended in them; a
 myriad of tubes criss-cross the ceiling and descend into the tanks.
 In the middle of the room a group of about seven scientists in lab coats
 and goggles are working at some tables with Bunsen burners, various chemical
 glassware, and microscopes.
 Along the left side of the room is a bank of computers and monitors, and
 three agents in armored jump-suits, with bandoleers and sidearms are working
 on them.
 At the rear of the room, on a raised platform that takes up the entire
 back of the room, there is some sort of metallic table with restraints
 and three huge ominous ray devices pointing at it.
 Light is coming from standard panels in the ceiling, like the rest of the
 base, and there is another closed Blast Door at the far end past the platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players are free to assume that there are features that aren't explicitly
 mentioned, as long as they make sense given what they're told is there,
 but they should exercise some restraint when it comes to unusual, too convenien
t, or bizarre features.
 A mad scientist's biology lab certainly has glassware, might have rats
 or even monkeys in cages, but almost certainly doesn't have a pool full
 of hippopotamuses unless the GM has mentioned it or it's somehow in keeping
 with the enemy's persona.

Buildings are similar to Bases, but will usually lack any Abilities except
 a Automatic Defense and Toughness, which will start at PL 6 and the Scope
 Level respectively, but can be higher for special-purpose or hardened buildings
 such as prisons or armories.
 As with Vehicles, merely getting an Out on a Building with a Power on the
 same Scope as the building doesn't destroy it...it breaches the building's
 security and perhaps a wall.
 To be able to destroy a building in a single blast requires scoring an
 Out with a Power 
\series bold
3 levels
\series default
 higher in Scope.
 E.g., it takes a Power on the Cosmic scale to potentially destroy the whole
 world in a shot, or Power on a National scale such as a fighter jet to
 destroy an entire sky-scraper.
 You can destroy a building with lesser Power, if you keep applying it,
 such as a tank destroying a large sky scraper, but it's up to the Primary
 Rule to determine how long it takes or if it can be done at all...after all
 a single M1 Abrams tank can't expect to destroy an entire city by itself
 in any reasonable amount of time.

More Stuff To Break

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world is full of stuff for adventurers to break.
 Most of the time this can be handled by simple application of the Primary
 Rule, particularly when the character is setting out to break it.
 If a Street Level character wants to smash through an ordinary interior
 door using his Abilities, the door should smash.
 Sometimes, though, it's questionable whether the character has sufficient
 power, such as when a Street Level character wants to smash through a bank
 vault door.
 Power Level 6 is enough to lift a motorcycle, but to break open a bank
 vault?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the Collateral Damage rules, random objects generally have
 Toughness equal to the minimum Scope at which a number of them tend to
 appear, and the Default Skill (PL 4) for resisting attacks.
 Hot Dog stands and fire hydrants are Street Level (3), News stands and
 cars are Neighborhood Level (4), and so on.
 Attacks at the same or lesser Scope will break the object on an Out result,
 but not destroy it; and destroy it on Overkill.
 Attacks from a higher Scope character will destroy an object with an Out,
 though it takes 
\series bold
three
\series default
 levels higher to destroy a building or similarly huge object (or collection
 of objects, such as a city block or office park).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Particularly tough objects, such as bank vaults, should be given the benefit
 of the three levels rule as if they were buildings, and possibly an actual
 Automatic Defense; realistically a bank vault would probably survive the
 complete destruction of the bank, so it would be somewhat implausible for
 a enemy who couldn't destroy the building to be able to smash the vault
 in a single blow.

Perils and Obstacles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:PerilsAndObstacles"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world is full of dangerous things that can injure or inconvenience the
 unwary character: rivers of bubbling lava, perilous crumbling cliffs, tanks
 containing sharks with frickin' laser beams on their foreheads, and other
 perils too numerous to mention.
 Perils are treated as Automatic Attack Powers.
 Obstacles are treated as Automatic Powers that attempt to Counter certain
 actions, most often movement or senses.
 A patch of oil that attempted to Counter any movement across it would be
 a Obstacle; a patch of oil that was on fire would be a Peril, and perhaps
 an Obstacle to sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM should assign a Power Level based on a combination of how difficult
 to avoid or how deadly or effective it is.
 A rivulet of lava only 2 feet across will probably have a lower Power Level
 than a cloud of sleep gas that completely fills the room.
 A patch of loose gravel that made running difficult would have a lower
 Power Level than an oil slick, even if it covered a much larger area.
 When the characters interact with the Peril, such as when a room is filled
 with sleep gas or if dumped in among the sharks, treat is as an attack
 against their defense.
 The Peril should act against the character once per Round, generally on
 the character's Turn to make it easier to track.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When characters interact with a Obstacle, the Obstacle should attempt to
 Counter their actions whenever they narrate something that would interact
 with it, such as riding their motorcycle across the oil slick; treat it
 as a normal attempt to Counter, where they have the usual options of aborting
 to save their Power and Action, rolling against it to see if they succeed
 anyway, or spending an Action to use some other Power to counter it (such
 as shooting a nearby sandbag to spill sand across the oil slick before
 trying to ride over it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perils are often non-lethal.
 Non-lethal Perils can still potentially put characters Out, either by actually
 knocking them out, or by removing them from combat for three Turns.
 E.g., if a dam bursts and inundates the character, scoring an Out against
 the appropriate defense could represent the character being washed away
 down river and needing three Turns to return rather than being unconscious.
 If something can't reasonably put a character Out, only inconvenience them
 or block their actions, treat it as a Obstacle instead.
 Slippery floors, or clouds of obscuring gas are almost always Obstacles,
 not Perils.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some things might be treated as both: a river of lava might be a Obstacle
 if you attempt to cross it, and a Peril if you fail and fall in.
 Use the Primary Rule to decide which, given the circumstances.
 Such things should typically have different Power Levels as a Peril or
 a Obstacle: being extremely deadly does not automatically make something
 nearly impossible to avoid or overcome, and vice versa.

\begin_layout Standard
Perils and Obstacles should never use Wild Shot, or exert Supreme Effort,
 but simultaneous perils might Combine Actions, and clever characters might
 try to combine their Power with them.
 If the ceiling of the secret lair is caving in at the same time that the
 character is trying to leap to safety over the bubbling lava, treat it
 as a Combined Obstacle acting to Counter his leap.
 This works out slightly to the character's favor, but speeds things along.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that since Perils count as Automatic Attacks there's no limit to how
 many times they can attack in a Round as long as the conditions that trigger
 the attack are met.
 The Peril will only attack a given character on its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

own initiative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 once per Round, but other characters can try to incorporate the Peril into
 a Combined Attack as many times as they like, provided they can justify
 it by the Primary Rule.
 For instance, you might combine Martial Arts with the room filled with
 sleep gas by saying you were punching the foe in the gut to force him to
 breathe some in.
 Remember that combining attacks with Automatic Powers such as Perils always
 use the lesser Power as the base, and add to that.
 E.g.
 Martial Arts PL 8 and Sleep Gas PL 6 would combine to a PL 6+1 attack not
 a PL 8+1...but since the Sleep Gas is the base, if it had any advantages like
 vs.
 Stamina those would apply to the combined attack, just as the martial artist
 intended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perils and Obstacles might behave as if they had certain Advantages and
 Disadvantages, such as being Area Affect, or Exotic, or Single Use, just
 as if they were a normal Power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the character tries to eliminate the Peril or Obstacle, say by freezing
 the lava in place, treat that as an attack to Disable the Power.
 It's possible that a Peril or a Obstacle is so dangerous or permanent it
 can't be eliminated, for instance a sea of lava in a Neighborhood campaign;
 in that case don't even assign it a number, just say it's beyond the character'
s abilities.
 The GM should assign a Toughness based on how easy it is to eliminate the
 Peril or Obstacle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like all Abilities, Perils and Obstacles follow the Primary Rule.
 It doesn't matter that the river of lava is defined as a Obstacle, if the
 character has flight she can just fly over it without having to roll her
 Flight Movement Power versus the lava's attempt to Counter.
 If she decides to dive in it to see if there's something at the bottom
 and her only defense is Acrobatics, then the lava doesn't need to roll--she's
 going to get burned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating an Obstacle or Peril
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters can create Obstacles or Perils with their Abilities.
 Generally, treat these as if they have the same Power Level as the Ability
 used to create it.
 If a character uses his PL 6 Ice Ray to create an ice slick on the floor,
 that becomes a PL 6 Obstacle to anybody trying to cross it.
 The character won't have to continue to spend Actions in subsequent Rounds;
 instead the Obstacle should last a reasonable amount of time, generally
 until the end of the scene unless somebody Disables it to eliminate it.

Out by a Peril
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:OutByAPeril"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important difference between a Peril and a enemy is that when it comes
 to being Out, in most campaigns enemies will let up rather than attempt
 to finish the job if for no other reason than they have bigger fish to
 fry than beating on a helpless character.
 Perils, particularly when they're environmental factors like high radiation
 or poison gas, will continue as long as the character remains exposed,
 putting the character Down for the Count on the second Round.
 This can present a problem if you want a low-lethality campaign; if so
 the GM should give the character's companions ample opportunity to rescue
 the character before any permanent harm is done, if necessary helping along
 by narrating the Out in such a way that rescue is still plausible (e.g.,
 falling victim to the fumes on a small outcropping surrounded by the lava
 rather than plunging right into it).
 If they fail to do so, and there's no plausible way for the character to
 jump back in after the usual three Turns then the character is missing,
 presumed dead.
 The player should decide whether to leave the character in that state for
 a while, playing a different character in the meantime, or have the character
 return almost immediately.
 In any case, in order to return, the player needs to come up with an explanatio
n for the character's miraculous escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that it is perfectly acceptable to use a Shtick to create a Peril or
 Obstacle; this is one way you can promote a non-combat Ability to be useful
 in combat.
 Thus, a character with a Computer Systems Shtick couldn't use it to attack
 a group of Empire Troopers directly, but could use the Shtick to override
 the blast doors separating them, thus creating an Obstacle they would have
 to surmount, or even open the hangar bay doors, creating a Peril that threatens
 to sweep them out into the void of space.
 The disadvantage, of course, is that Obstacles and Perils don't discriminate
 between the character's friends and foes, so an ally on the wrong side
 of the blast doors is just as stuck as the Troopers, and in just as much
 trouble when the chamber is voided into space.

In most Science Fiction, equipment plays a big part in the story, whether
 it's the smuggler's trusty blaster or the science officer's tricorder.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

you should assume that Powers and Shticks that you use require equipment.
 and the equipment you're using should be part of your narration of what
 you're doing.
 You are reduced to one die (as if you were Hindered) in that Ability if
 you don't have appropriate equipment (e.g.
 guns or knives for a Power like Soldier, medical kit for a Shtick such
 as Doctor).
 Abilities that have taken the Advantage Bare-handed aren't subject to this;
 a typical such Power might be Martial Arts.
 Abilities that have the Disadvantage Equipment Required don't even get
 a single die; they just can't be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time, players can assume they have whatever equipment they need
 to hand...or just pick up some improvised equipment.
 Somebody with a Power Elite Commando caught without a rifle while in a
 hotel dirt-side on R&R when some terrorists attack can narrate grabbing
 a handy mop and breaking off the head to use as a staff until she can knock
 one out and take his gun.
 The point is to encourage such narration for flavor, not to enforce bookkeeping
 of everything the character is carrying at every moment.
 There should, however, be times when in all fairness it is unreasonable
 to assume that there is adequate equipment handy, and the player should
 endure the handicap until some can be procured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Equipment Dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specific pieces of Equipment in Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

are rated in terms of a single die; characters using the equipment can use
 that die in place of one of their own if it would improve the dice rolled.
 For instance, a pistol might be rated at d6.
 An untrained person who would ordinary roll a d2 for his attack would instead
 roll a d6.
 A trained police officer with a Power Police Training 4 would roll a d6,
 d4 instead of d4, d4.
 If he had PL 5 he'd roll d6, d6 instead of d6, d4.
 On the other hand, an Elite Commando PL 8 would still roll d8, d8; the
 pistol wouldn't improve on that, though it would justify using both dice
 instead of being reduced to one for being unequipped.
 Equipment can be given the same Advantages and Disadvantages that Abilities
 can, raising and lowering the Equipment Rating by one die size instead
 of one Power Level.
 E.g.
 a Pistol d6 with the Shots Disadvantage becomes d8; a Grenade d8 with the
 Area Effect Advantage becomes d6, etc.

Variations in Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should assume that there is wide variation in capabilities of the items
 listed, even if its not reflected in a mechanical difference between the
 items.
 These differences should become fodder for the Primary Rule in play.
 For example, mechanically all primitive armor is just a d4 vs.
 muscle-powered weapons, but that doesn't mean that in play you should treat
 plate armor and a leather jacket as being identical; you are strongly encourage
d to decide on the fly that, say, according to the Primary Rule and the
 tone of the campaign swimming underwater in plate is forbidden, but a dagger
 has no chance of even Hindering somebody clad in plate except under special
 circumstances such as in combination with an attack that immobilizes the
 wearer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM and players are strongly encouraged to invent details about the equipment
 in keeping with the setting, even if the details have no game-mechanical
 effect, since they can provide fodder for the Primary Rule.
 For instance in the modern day there are many makes and models of cars,
 with varying features such as numbers of doors, convertible roofs, automatic
 or manual transmission, differences in trunk size, side of the car the
 gas-cap is on, and so on.
 Any of these things might plausibly come up in the course of play as justifying
 or forbidding certain actions based on the Primary Rule, even though in
 game terms anything from a Toyota Camry to a VW Beetle or a Ford F150 pickup
 truck might be described simply as Ground Car d6.
 In a SF setting, equipment is likely to be just as varied and interesting,
 and the GM players should try to bear that in mind, inventing details where
 necessary.

\begin_layout Standard
A roll of doubles when using Equipment is a chance of a Mishap, or a 1 if
 you're only rolling 1 die.
 If there's a chance of a Mishap, roll a d12 and get higher than the Equipment
 Die size to prevent the Mishap.
 Remember you only have to check for Mishaps if you have a Disadvantage
 that requires it, such as the Erratic Disadvantage from not maintaining
 the equipment.
 (If you find it simpler you can just roll a d12 when you have to check
 for Mishaps and a 1 is a Mishap; it's just a matter of whether you prefer
 to have to roll an extra d12 every time or only once in a while.)

\begin_layout Section
Reparing and Building Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to repair broken equipment make an opposed roll of a suitable ability
 vs.
 the equipment's die; beating the equipment's roll means it can be repaired.
 The number it rolled is the number of Rounds it will take to make operational
 in combat, or Scenes out-of-combat.
 This biases repair times in favor of quick repairs in combat, but that
 matches most of the genre fiction.
 Failure in combat means that it needs to be repaired out of combat; failure
 out-of-combat means it needs to be replaced, at least in part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building new equipment works essentially the same way, but must be done
 out-of-combat unless using a Scientist's Science! skill.
 New equipment costs roughly the same as buying the equipment, unless it
 seems plausible that 90% of the cost of the equipment is labor (as might
 be the case with primitive labor-intensive items such as mail armor).
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Wealth"

\end_inset

 for more about Wealth and costs.
 The advantage to building it yourself is that you can get equipment to
 your exact specifications, or in places that it might not otherwise be
 available on local markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cybernetic Enhancemetns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally speaking cybernetic enhancements, or cyberwear, shouldn't be purchased
 as Equipment in Zap! Rather, since once installed it becomes an innate
 part of the character it would be purchased with personal Boosts.
 Only in a setting where cybernetic enhancements were frequently swapped
 in and out during the course of an adventure according to the needs of
 the moment would it make sense to write it up as equipment and let players
 purchase it for their characters with wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In such a setting, assume that nearly anything that could be purchased as
 Equipment can be installed as an enhancement, but would Cost would +1 for
 the Advantage Cyberwear, and possibly another +1 if it has the Advantage
 Concealable as well.

Example Equipment

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all of this equipment will be available in every setting, and the GM
 is encouraged to change the basic parameters to better match the setting.
 Perhaps all Laser guns must have the Burnout Disadvantage to represent
 the limited lifespan of the tubes that generate the laser.
 Even if the equipment exists in the setting, there's no guarantee that
 the PCs will be able to purchase it: a Portal Gun might be a top secret
 weapon, only available as a prototype in a sinister laboratory.

\begin_layout Standard
Ships in Zap!
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

are treated as characters in their own right, but they have slightly different
 Attributes: Toughness, Hull Capacity, Power, and Crew.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ships are also rated by Scale which describes how large and effective they
 are compared to other ships; Scale is not an Attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toughness works exactly as it does for characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hull Capacity is the number of slots the ship has to fit Powers; a Power
 takes up 1 Hull Space, a Shtick takes 1/2 a Hull Space.
 You can't have fractional Hull Capacity values, but you can have unused
 space.
 Hull Capacity values are fixed when the ship is constructed; you can upgrade
 everything else about a ship, but if you want a bigger hull you need a
 new ship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Power is how much power the ship has for running systems, primarily for
 purposes of pushing more power into them using such Tropes as “Divert Power
 to...” Power functions more or less as a combination of Will and Stamina.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crew is how many Actions the ship can take in a Round, not counting actions
 performed by the PCs.
 Crew 0 means that any Ability you want to use in a Turn must have a PC
 assigned to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How fast ships travel between planets and stars is at a different Scope
 from individual characters, and is determined by the Campaign Scope for
 the setting.
 That is, if the campaign is Scope 10 Near Interstellar, then all ships
 in the campaign are presumed to be Scope 10 unless otherwise noted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical Powers for Ships include: Weapons, Shields, FTL Drive, Impulse Engines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical Shticks include Sensors, Life Support, Sick Bay, Cargo Bay(s), Labs,
 Engineering, Hydroponics, Vehicle Bay, Shuttle Bay, Life Pods, Cold Sleep
 Chambers, Recreation Deck, Brig, Ship's Stores, Ship's Library.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any Power that would be typical in the setting but that your ship is not
 equipped with is assumed to be present, but at minimal Power Level (Default
 Skill), unless that would be silly (a Brig on a one-man fighter).

\begin_layout Standard
Ship-to-ship takes place the same way that combat between characters does,
 except that Damage is assigned randomly against the ship's Abilities instead
 of taken against the ship as a whole.
 Each ship's system (Power or Shtick) should be assigned a number.
 Each time an attacker scores a success, figure out the degree of success
 as normal and then roll a die to see which system was hit.
 Systems that are Hindered are still operational, but at one die; systems
 that are Out are broken, but repairable, and systems that are Overkilled
 are destroyed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When rolling for damage location in ship-to-ship combat Automatic defensive
 abilities have no special resistance to being Hindered or Out: if the die-roll
 for damage location indicates they are hit, they take the damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When systems are destroyed, do not reduce the size of the die you're using
 to determine the system hit; if an already destroyed system is hit again,
 reduce the Crew by 1, if the Crew is reduced to zero, then the ship is
 Out unless there are PCs left on it.
 If there are PCs on the ship, and the Crew is at 0, then each time the
 Crew is would be reduced by 1, a PC is Out; the PC should be chosen randomly
 from the ones working on the system, or if none were then from the remaining
 PCs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an already destroyed system is hit by an an Overkill, the ship is destroyed
 regardless of remaining Crew.
 A ship is also destroyed if all of its systems are destroyed.
 Anything less, and the crew of the ship or PCs can still attempt to get
 its systems—or at least some of them—working again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that while ships with larger hulls, more systems, and more Crew
 are in general harder to render helpless, a lucky shot can destroy one,
 and battles don't drag out until the final system of the ship is broken.

\begin_layout Subsection
Attempts to Disable
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Attempts-to-Disable"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can attempt to Disable a specific system, as per the usual rules, but
 you must roll twice: first against the ship's normal defenses, and only
 if you beat them proceed to roll against the Power Level of the system
 you are targeting.
 You may not attempt to Disable any system that isn't represented by an
 Ability.
 E.g.
 if the target ship doesn't have Sensors as one of its Powers or Shticks,
 it's assumed that they are too spread out, small, or redundant to make
 a legitimate identifiable target.
 Automatic Defenses 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 have the usual resistance to being reduced if they are specifically targeted:
 the damage level can never be more than Hindered unless the attacker is
 using a Power with the Disabling Only Advantage.

Repairs
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Repairs"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repairing systems decreases their damage by one step.
 You need to Repair a system more than once to bring it back up multiple
 steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hindered systems can be Repaired by characters with the appropriate Abilities
 by spending an entire Round and making an opposed roll against the PL of
 the system (more powerful systems are trickier to repair).
 If they beat the system's roll, the system is back up immediately; if they
 fail, the shortfall is the number of Rounds before the system will be back
 online.
 E.g.
 Spotty tries to repair the ship's Engines with his Engineering 5 vs.
 the ship's engines of 6.
 He rolls d6, d4 and gets a 2, the engines roll d6, d6 and get a 5: it will
 be 3 Rounds before they're back online.
 Rolling a Mishap causes system to “attack” technician doing the repairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the characters don't like the result they can spend another Round to
 re-roll, but if the result is worse they've experienced a set-back and
 it will indeed take longer than they originally thought.
 They can keep trying rolls as many Rounds as they wish, but Rounds spent
 this way don't count towards the Rounds until the System is repaired.
 During this time the Hindered system continues to remain available at a
 single die.
 If they wished to take the system offline completely, that will reduce
 the amount of time it will take to repair it by 
\series bold
3
\series default
 Rounds (to a minimum 1 Round).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broken systems can be Repaired, using the same procedure as Hindered systems,
 but require parts.
 Ships with an actual Ships Stores Ability or the equivalent may roll vs.
 the PL of the system that needs parts: success means the needed parts are
 available; failure means resorting to one of the other options.
 Parts not available from the stores can be obtained by cannibalizing other
 ship's systems, or by adventuring for them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Destroyed systems cannot be repaired in combat.
 Out of combat, they can be Repaired with a successful roll at the cost
 of 1 XP; a failure means they are thoroughly destroyed and must be repurchased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are using the optional Wealth rules, you can obtain replacement parts
 by spending 1 Wealth Point.
 This happens immediately, even during combat, to reduce book-keeping; it's
 assumed the parts are scrounged from non-critical parts that will need
 replacing.
 If you don't have the WP, you may make the repair, but you cannot make
 any future repairs except by cannibalizing until you've spent a WP on restockin
g parts; presumably if you're running a ship while that poor, you've been
 putting off resupplying and scrounging everything that was scroungeable
 for already just for routine maintenance.
 Destroyed systems may be repaired on a successful roll by spending 1 WP
 instead of 1 XP.
\end_layout

Cannibalizing
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Cannibalizing"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any ship's system that's an actual Ability can be cannibalized: cannibalizing
 systems increases the damage they've taken by one step.
 Destroyed systems can be cannibalized, but it requires a roll equivalent
 to the Repair roll (roll vs.
 PL to see how many Rounds before you can recover useful parts).
 If a character rolls a Mishap while cannibalizing a Destroyed system, she
 suffers an attack as it explodes or short-circuits: roll the systems PL
 vs.
 the appropriate defense.
 You can cannibalize from the same system more than once, increasing its
 damage by one step each time, but once you've cannibalized a Destroyed
 system it cannot be Repaired even out of combat, and must be purchased
 anew.

\begin_layout Standard
If a ship ever loses Life Support, either because of damage to the system
 or because it was powered down (as in Silent Running), the crew will start
 to suffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Round in combat or Scene outside of combat, make a Hindered (one die)
 Life Support roll vs.
 the Crew Attribute, or the Crew become Tired: all ship's systems they control
 operate at one die.
 If they become Tired twice, they become Out.
 Another 
\series bold
3
\series default
 times after that they are Out and they start dying.
 Use the Hindered Life Support roll even if the system is destroyed: better,
 more powerful Life Support systems take longer to degrade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time a Tired result comes up, PCs can elect to sacrifice one point
 of Stamina instead.
 At 0 Stamina they are Out.
 If the ship has no Crew Attribute (the PCs are the only crew), treat it
 as a Tired result any time a 1 comes up on the Life Support roll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PC Actions
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:PC-Actions"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When PCs are aboard a ship they may either spend their Actions using their
 own Abilities, such as when they are running around trying to repair things
 on the ship, provide medical assistance to the crew, or do research in
 the lab to cobble together a weapon to stop the alien attackers, 
\emph on
or
\emph default
 they may serve as crew manning one of the ship's abilities.
 Each PC that takes over supervising the functions of one of the ship's
 Abilities in effect gives the ship an extra Action during that Round, at
 the expense of that PC's own Actions.
 When PCs are using the ship's Abilities, they treat it as Equipment, using
 the better of the Ability's best die and their own best die or the Ability's
 dice.
 E.g.
 if the ship's guns are PL 6 (d6, d6), a PC who had Gunner 8 (d8, d8) would
 roll a d8, d6 (her great gunning improves the chances, but she's still
 limited by how good the guns are); a PC who had Gunner 4 (d4, d4) would
 roll a d6, d6 (having a PC in charge never makes the it worse).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalent to the Supreme Effort Trope for characters, you can add the ship's
 Power rating to a roll, after which the Power drops by one.
 If the Power reaches zero, the ship's systems operate at one die, much
 as when a character is Tired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Engines Can't Take It!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A character with an Engineering Ability or the equivalent can use the equivalent

 or power plant, after which the system becomes Broken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Silent Running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By powering down all systems, including life support, the ship becomes invisible
 or thought of as derelict to any scans at longer than Short Range (any
 other ship that wasn't already at Short Range per the Short Range Disadvantages
 would have to spend Actions to close to Short Range before they could detect
 the ruse).
 Each Round you spend in Silent Running requires a Life Support roll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Option: Faster Ship Combat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard ship-to-ship combat in Zap! takes approximately as long as a normal
 combat between the characters as individuals and a similar number of foes,
 with systems being eliminated one-by-one and the characters having time
 to repair them...although a lucky shot or clever tactics can end it faster;
 this is by design, since the elimination of the character's ship generally
 defeats the entire party at once.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you prefer to speed up ship-to-ship combat, one way is to have each hit
 on a specific system knock it down one level.
 Thus, a Hindered system that takes another hit would become Broken, even
 if the damage didn't exceed the ship's Toughness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can speed it up even more by treating the ship as a single character,
 and having entire ship become Hindered or Broken as a single unit.
 This offers a lot less leeway for individual characters to make a difference,
 or for manuevering and reversals of fortune, but is much more practical
 when more than a couple of ships are involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can decide which way you will handle combat on a case-by-case basis,
 or even distinguish between ships so that capital class ships take damage
 to individual systems while lesser ships are treated as a unit.
 You could even have only the PC's ship use the detailed approach, while
 all enemy ships are treated as single units.

Ship Scale
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Scale for a ship describes how large and effective that ship is compared
 to other ships regardless of Adventure Scope.
 A ship could range from a single-person craft to a colony ship with millions
 of inhabitants regardless of whether the Adventure Scope is 10 (Near Interstell
ar) or 14 (Galactic Cluster).
 The Scale of the Ship is the number of digits in the crew complement.
 A ship at Scale 1 has crew in the single digits; a ship at Scale 3 has
 hundreds of crew, and so on.
 If you're using the optional Wealth rules, that's also the Scale of ship's
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "chap:Wealth"

\end_inset

.
 The Crew attribute indicates how many crew the ship has given the Scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g.
 a smuggler's ship with a handful of crew would have Ship Scale 1.
 If the ship's Crew Attribute were 2, that would indicate 2 crew members;
 a deep-space exploration vessel with 435 crew would be Crew 4 at Scale
 3.
 A battle carrier with 1,000 crew members could be Crew 10 at Scale 3 or
 Crew 1 at Scale 4, depending on what's more convenient for the setting:
 is it one of the largest ships in its class, or the smallest? A ship the
 size of a moon with around 300,000 crew would be Crew 3 at Scale 6, and
 so on.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ship Scale and Effectiveness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When ships of different Scales are in combat, their non-Movement Abilities
 are scaled; Movement Abilities and Attributes remain fixed since it's typical
 in Science Fiction for small ships to be able to outrun larger ones, and
 to be able to survive one or more hits even from a bigger ship's weapons.
 For every Scale you move a ship, raise or lower the score on its Abilities
 by 2 depending on whether the ship is being shifted to a Scale where it's
 relatively more or less powerful.
 Abilities never go below 1.
 Usually you would shift the side that has the fewest different types of
 ships, to minimize the work; otherwise, leave the PC's ship(s) and shift
 their enemies, so the players can just look at what's listed on the character
 sheet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g.
 the Peregrine runs across an Empire Star-cruiser, a Scale 3 ship with hundreds
 of crew and huge guns.
 At its normal Scale the Star-cruiser has Guns 5, Shields 4, and Drive 3.
 At Scale 1 its Guns count as 9, the Shields count as 8, and the Drive remains
 at 3.
 None of the Attributes change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you were doing it the other way around, shifting the Peregrine to Scale
 3, the Peregrine's Movement 5, Deflector Shields 4 and Gun Turrets 4 become
 Movement 5, Deflector Shields 1, and Gun Turrets 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Settings with Multiple Adventure Scopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the campaign setting actually has multiple Adventure Scopes, say with
 some cultures at Scope 10 (Near Interstellar) and others at Scope 14 (Galactic
 Cluster), Ship Scale is subordinate to the Adventure Scope; that is, a
 Ship Scale 3 ship belonging to a Galactic Cluster civilization is presumably
 much more powerful than a Ship Scale 6 craft belonging to the Near Interstellar
 culture.
 In situations with mixed Scopes like this, if it becomes necessary to compare
 the ships in combat or with one trying to evade the other, first convert
 the ships from Adventure Scope to Adventure Scope using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:CrossingScopes"

\end_inset

 rules, then if necessary from Ship Scale to Ship Scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g.
 if the Star-cruiser from the previous example came from a Scope 14 civilization
 and the Peregrine from a Scope 12, the Star-cruiser would first be converted
 from Guns 5, Shields 4, and Drive 3 to Guns 8, Shields 6, Drive 5, and
 then to Guns 12, Shields 10, Drive 5.
 On the other hand, if the Star-cruiser were from a Scope 10 civilization,
 the Star-cruiser would first be reduced to Guns 3, Shields 2, Drive 1 by
 translating two Scopes upward, and the shifted to Guns 7, Shields 6, Drive
 1 to put it on the same Ship Scale as the Peregrine.

\begin_layout Chapter
Trekking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science Fiction stories often have a good deal of fairly routine travel:
 not every space voyage is punctuated by pirate attack, receiving a distress
 call, or encountering a mysterious alien entity.
 But if play skips over the days, weeks, or even months of routine to get
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 space can end up feeling very small, with treks halfway across the galaxy
 feeling like a trip down to the corner store.
 To combat this and give texture to the routine ship-board activities that
 make up a large part of genre, Zap! uses a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just the highlights
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system called Trekking, which rates travel distances in terms of Scenes
 needed to complete the travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the Adventure Scope and technology of the setting, the GM should
 determine how much subjective time (how many Scenes) should pass to trek
 between the closest points for long-distance highlights-only travel.
 Longer distances should then be made proportional to that.
 For example, at a Near Interstellar Scope, the GM could decide that distances
 between planets in a single solar system using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

impulse power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should take a few days, while the closest stars would be weeks away using
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

warp drive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the frontier a couple of months.
 Based on this, she decides that travel between planets takes between one
 and three Scenes; between close stars 6 to 12, and the frontier would be
 21+ Scenes away.
 Note the deliberate discontinuity, so that embarking on an interstellar
 journey feels like a significantly more time-consuming enterprise than
 hopping around in-system; also note that the number of scenes needn't be
 strictly proportional...if a trip that takes a day requires one Scene, a trip
 that takes a week doesn't necessarily require seven Scenes.
 A GM who wanted the players to be able to flit from system to system more
 casually could reduce the numbers, say to 1, 3 and 6 Scenes respectively,
 or even skip Trekking entirely and hand-wave everything as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

3 months later, you arrive.

Scenes
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Scene during Trekking is exactly like a scene in a book or a movie: a
 single situation or incident, usually in a single location.
 This can be a description by one of the players some activity their character
 is performing during the trip, such as maintaining their equipment (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Maintenance"

\end_inset

), training, performing Research, or role-playing a conversation or interaction
 between several of the PCs or the PCs and NPCs.
 It can also be some incident or encounter that the GM presents: if the
 ship actually does encounter some pirates or a distress call, that counts
 as a Scene towards completion of the journey.
 Scenes needn't all take place shipboard; feel free to include stops along
 the way to refuel, trade, explore, or for some R&R, as appropriate for
 the setting and the PC's goals.
 Some of these may turn into adventures in their own right, while others
 might just be short interludes and an opportunity to insert some local
 color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scenes can be as short or as long as you care to make them, but the point
 of playing out the Scenes is to give the players some interesting memories
 of what happened during their trek from Point A to Point B, not merely
 to force them to do a slow count to ten before the action can resume.
 This is a good opportunity to work in some of the Complications of the
 various characters or the ship itself, or to give some spotlight time to
 characters that haven't been front-and-center of the action recently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Translating Distance to Scenes
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Translating-Distance-to"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the GM has worked out exact travel distances between various locales
 and speeds for various forms of transportation, that can be translated
 directly into Scenes by assigning a unit of time for a One-Scene trip.
 E.g.
 if you say travel takes one Scene per day, then a ship capable of traveling
 1 light-year per day would take 12 Scenes to complete a 12 light-year trip,
 while a ship that can travel 6 light-years per day would take only 2 Scenes
 for the same trip.
 Fractional Scenes should be dropped.
 If the setting uses more abstract distance, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jumps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a fixed duration, you can peg the Scenes to Jumps, say 2 Scenes per
 jump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the way you work out the number of Scenes supposes a certain
 number of scenes per unit of time, that doesn't imply that Scenes ought
 to take that long, or be spaced out evenly.
 E.g.
 if you're translating one week's travel = one Scene, the individual Scenes
 don't have to occur one per week like clockwork; if it makes sense, you
 should immediately follow one Scene with another, such as a Scene where
 the PCs decide to land on a planet to trade followed immediately by another
 Scene where they hunt for bargains in the bazaar, and another where they
 get drunk in a local bar.
 If that's all the Scenes that are required to complete the journey they
 were on, that just means that you should make the remaining weeks pass
 without incident once they get underway again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM could also use a sliding scale, typically to make longer distance
 travel less tedious, such as by making Trekking take one Scene per day
 up to 7 Scenes, then an additional two Scene per week up to one month (another
 8 Scenes), and three Scenes per month's travel thereafter.
 This would have the advantage of making a contemplated 6 month journey
 still seem like it would take a significant amount of time as measured
 in Scenes without forcing the players to figure out 180 Scenes to fill
 up the time; on the other hand, depending on the setting you might want
 a six month journey that crosses the entirety of known space to be a daunting
 prospect that will take months of playing...or at least prod the players into
 thinking about getting a faster ship.

Cutting to the Chase
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Cutting-to-the"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't slow down the action or insist on playing out the Scenes just to prolong
 the process of travel.
 If the players are chasing some fleeing bad-guys, by all means skip ahead,
 even if it would normally amount to a bunch more Scenes.
 Keep a sense of pacing, and don't fritter away any sense of urgency the
 players have built up.
 If they want to cut to the chase, oblige them.
 If they don't want to play out the process of traveling at all, and would
 rather just start each adventure orbiting a new planet, then drop the Trekking
 rules all together...though you should probably still try to include some
 time in each session for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

down time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 activities.
 Even action-adventure SF TV shows usually include some scenes of normal
 activity each episode as a change of pace or to allow for character development
; non-stop action can be as tedious as no action at all.

Science and engineering form core elements of Science Fiction stories, so
 it's not surprising that many protagonists are scientists or engineers
 and are constantly doing research or tinkering with devices.
 In Zap!
\begin_inset space ~

characters with the Scientist Template can do Research Scenes to revise
 and expand their Science!
\begin_inset space ~

Power to the needs of the adventure, but that's just one way that research
 into new technology, devices, and scientific knowledge can come into play.
 Characters may also perform Research to gain new Assets and improve upon
 their existing ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once each session, characters may perform a Research scene using any appropriate
 Ability (the Scientist's Scientific Research Shtick, or any science or
 engineering Shtick that characters using other Templates may have).
 The characters choose an Asset (see
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Assets"

\end_inset

) that they want to improve upon with research and tinkering, or a new Asset
 they want to create.
 The Difficulty for the Research is the PL of the Asset.
 Scoring a success grants 1 XP for improving that Asset, or towards its
 purchase for a new one; if the 1 XP from success isn't enough to buy the
 improvement or new Asset immediately, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it as belonging to that particular Asset.
 When making a Research roll, always check for a Mishap even if the Power
 doesn't have a Disadvantage that would call for a check.
 If a Mishap occurs, the GM should invent something interesting that went
 wrong, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Shower of sparks, some piece of equipment is broken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 Perhaps the researcher is split into a good version and a bad version,

A new Minor Asset costs 1 XP; Major Assets that belong to the players jointly
 cost 3 XP; Major Assets that belong to a particular character cost as many
 XP as that character has Boosts.
 Improving Assets costs as many XP as the Asset has in Boosts.
 A Minor Asset is generally something like a piece of equipment: the PL
 is the die-size.
 A Major Asset is generally something that's treated almost as a character,
 like a Vehicle, Base, or Companion, with its own Attributes and Abilities.
 The GM should determine what the Attributes and Abilities of a new Major
 Asset are, following the description by the players of what they're trying
 to Research.

 Remember Assets like Companions, Bases, and Vehicles do

 count towards the character's number of Boosts, nor do Bonus Boosts for
 the Templates that have them.
 E.g., a starting Bad-Ass character has 3 Boosts plus 1 Bonus Boost, so it
 takes 3 XP to get an additional Boost.
 Once the character spends the XP on a personal improvement the character
 has 4 Boosts and so the next Boost would cost 4 XP.

It may seem that characters will advance very slowly given this system;

 personal power,

leveling up

 and getting new gear; when adventurers do get new powers it's a big event,

 the course of an adventure or the start of a new adventure, such as being
 captured and experimented on by a mad scientist or alien race.
 Instead of altering the core of the character, as a result of their adventures
 they widen their circle of contacts, aid people who may then owe them favors,

Wealth is an optional system in Zap! Many Science Fiction settings make
 the character's wealth irrelevant, or just part of the background: the
 characters are doing what they do to make money, but how much money is
 never really described nor do their actions seem particularly constrained
 by what things cost.
 Even if the setting doesn't suppose a post-scarcity economy, if you're
 on active duty and bankrolled by Star Fleet, how much it took to build
 your ship or to keep it running and in repair need never come up.
 On the other hand, a space-navy campaign might well have the captain of
 a ship assigned a budget that she needs to keep within, or have her personal
 wealth matter in terms her share of prizes awarded for the capture of enemy
 vessels.

\begin_layout Standard
Each level of Wealth represents an order of magnitude of Wealth that's available
 to your character; it doesn't represent a specific amount of money, rather
 it's assumed that anything that cost less than that order of magnitude
 (1,000's when your Wealth is measured in 10,000's) is basically free as
 long as you don't try to stock up on a dozen at a time.
 Things that are on the same order of magnitude (1,000's when your Wealth
 is in the 1,000's) are significant investments for you, and if you lose
 or expend them during play there's a chance that your Wealth level is reduced.
 Wealth is not given a concrete name: that is up to your setting.
 E.g.
 If the GM decides that a Laser Pistol costs somewhere in the hundreds in
 the setting, then a character with Wealth 3 can have one, but if she loses
 it that might adversely affect her wealth; if she has Wealth 4, then replacing
 it or buying an extra for a friend is no problem; a character with Wealth
 1 won't be able to afford one, and will have to try to get one in the course
 of adventuring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What Money is Called
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters in the setting may be dealing in credits, quatloos, double-dollars,
 cubits, and it may vary from place to place in the setting; all that Zap!
 tracks is the number of 
\emph on
digits
\emph default
 of wealth you have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Wealth and Adventure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GM should adjust your current Wealth level according to your fortunes
 while adventuring, using the orders of magnitude as a guide.
 Generally it's assumed that the character is making ends meet and the character
's income and expenses are in balance at the current Wealth level, including
 normal rewards for adventures (bounties collected, pay for services, and
 so on).
 If the character wants to increase Wealth through adventuring, the player
 should tell the GM she's looking for riskier, higher paying missions.
 If an employer offers the character substantially more than the usual,
 such as 30,000 for a mission when the character's Wealth Level is 2, after
 the mission the Wealth Level becomes 5....assuming the character survives and
 the employer pays up.
 Once at Wealth Level 5, missions and expenses will be assumed to be roughly
 on that scale.
 On the other hand, if your Wealth Level is 7 and you have to abandon ship
 and find yourself stranded on a semi-settled planet in nothing more than
 your enviro-suit, your Wealth Level may be reduced to 2 or even 1.

Wealth and Experience
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to increase your Wealth is simply to pay XP for it.
 Wealth is treated as a Minor Asset: pay 1 XP to begin at Level 4, 2 more
 XP to get to Level 5, etc.
 A starting character can thus start at Wealth 5 by spending 1 Boost.
 If you lose your Wealth as a result of an adventure, you don't get XP back.
 If your Wealth is increased as a result of adventuring, you don't have
 to pay for that, but if you want to increase it further, you have to pay
 the XP to the next Level cost just as if you'd bought it up that far to
 begin with.

Post-Scarcity Economies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some SF posits a setting with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

post-scarcity economy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that is one in which energy and matter are so abundant and so efficiently
 processed that all material wealth is free for all practical purposes.
 Except in the more outre or possibly within virtual environments, this
 is almost never literally true...there will be some things such as star ships,
 space colonies, habitable planets, that the citizens can't have as many
 as they want just for the taking.
 Nevertheless, in terms of day-to-day needs, the citizens may live in such
 abundance that there's no need to track their resources or expenses even
 on the abstract level of orders of magnitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mechanically, nothing could be easier than playing in a post-scarcity economy:
 don't track wealth, let the characters have or create whatever gear they
 want by means of replicators or whatever the setting uses, though there
 should still be some limit according to the tech of the setting as to what
 even the finest equipment is capable of.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tricky bit is making sure that character's motivations and actions still
 make sense, and adventures can still happen.
 If you're not paying close attention, it can be easy to let some of the
 assumptions and concerns of normal economies sneak in through the back
 door.
 You can't just assume that there are mines, factories, hospitals, warehouses,
 unless they're fully automated.
 If people don't engage in commerce, what do they do all day? Is there such
 a thing as robbery? Gambling? What would the stakes be? If there are still
 jobs that require humans, what induces them to take the jobs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Commerce
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commerce is a large part of certain Science Fiction stories, and nearly
 ignored in others, so like Wealth it's an optional system.
 Commerce can be used independently of the Wealth system; just treat WP
 as being XP in a setting that has Commerce without Wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Commerce system, Wealth has its own experience points called Wealth
 Points (WP).
 In order to increase your Wealth, you accumulate WP through adventure or
 Commerce.
 It takes 10 WP to increase your Wealth by one Level, regardless of your
 current level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Wealth and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals should generally use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Wealth-Levels"

\end_inset

 chart, regardless of their Personal Scope.
 Ships use Wealth at the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Ship-Scopes"

\end_inset

 of the ship, where each level increase in Scope increases the amount of
 wealth by a factor of 10.
 Thus, Wealth 4 for a Scope 3 ship is on the order of 100,000 instead of
 1,000.
 This affects the cost of repairs, as well as the profits to be made if
 you're using the Commerce system (e.g., cargo for a Scope 3 ship earns wealth
 on a scale 100 times larger than cargo for a Scope 1 ship).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the players want to convert Wealth Points back and forth from the ship's
 Scope to their own, convert it using the implied amount just as if they
 had earned (or spent) wealth on an adventure.
 That is, if the Ship Scope is 3 and it has Wealth 4, each WP it's earning
 is approximately 100,000.
 If the players at Personal Scope 1 decide to use one of those WP themselves
 that would immediately bump their own Wealth to 6 (the level where their
 wealth is measured in the 100,000's); if their Wealth was already 6, it
 would just go into their personal pool of WP; if their Wealth was higher
 than 6, it wouldn't have any effect.
 If the players in the example wanted to spend their own Wealth Points to
 repair or improve the ship, they would likewise need either to be Wealth
 6 so that their WP were on the order of 100,000, or higher than 6 in which
 case giving the ship one of their WP would raise its Wealth score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, however, that unless they own the ship free and clear, there should
 probably be repercussions from them taking the Wealth the ship has for
 their own use; if they are employees of the ship's owners, it's embezzlement;
 if they are paying off a mortgage on the ship, it's likely to make them
 late on payments; in any case it may make the ship low on spare parts or
 having gone without proper maintenance.
 The abstract measure of Wealth in Zap! assumes that at any given level
 expenses and income are roughly in balance and are tied up in maintaining
 that balance: Wealth Points are earnings towards increasing that Wealth,
 but generally shouldn't be thought of as idle piles of money.
 If the players start using them for other things, it should be used as
 fodder for in-game happenings and complications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Shipping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One standard way for characters in SF settings to earn wealth is by hiring
 out delivering goods and passengers.
 Usually this involves having a ship, but sometimes the characters are themselve
s passengers and are carrying or babysitting a smaller item or escorting
 a person.
 Even in a campaign without Commerce, many adventures will fit this rough
 structure; the Shipping rules don't replace actually playing out such adventure
s, rather they give the characters who wish to engage in commerce a simple,
 low risk, way to engage in some shipping 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the background
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and receive some WP rewards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players just announce they want to take on some cargo, and make a roll of
 the relevant Movement Ability compared to difficulty equal to the Movement
 PL
\series bold
 + 3
\series default
.
 The result is how many travel Scenes later they'll arrive at their destination
 and drop off the cargo for 1 WP.
 Shipping doesn't require setting a destination and actually getting there;
 the presumption is that characters are only taking on side-jobs carrying
 stuff to places they intend to go anyway.
 Naturally, you should pay attention to the Primary Rule to avoid making
 this ridiculous: if the characters need to do two travel Scenes to make
 the delivery and two travel Scenes later they're back in the same bar wait
 until they actually travel somewhere else before awarding the WP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The WP for shipping is on the same Scope as the Movement Ability that was
 used; transporting stuff with a ship will usually yield WP on a higher
 scale than the character walking under her own power.

Trade consists of characters purchasing goods with their own wealth, for
 resale later, hopefully at a profit.
 Trade is riskier than simply agreeing to transport cargo for a fee, but
 can yield much greater rewards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players who wish to purchase goods for later resale describe what Ability
 they are using via the Primary Rule to acquire or transport the cargo;
 for a ship, the Ability will generally be something like Cargo Bays, Passenger
 Cabins, Smuggler's Hidey-hole, Cryostasis Chambers, or the like.
 Players can Combine other Abilities such as Merchant or Streetwise Shticks
 to improve the roll, though they need to narrate how that's plausible (Streetwi
se, for instance, suggests they're engaged in transporting something shady).
 As with Shipping, the WP for Trade will be on the same Scope as the Ability
 that's used to justify engaging in Trade.
 Once a particular Ability is used for Trade, it's treated as Hindered for
 that purpose if you wish to use it again before selling the goods; once
 it's been used twice, it's no longer available.
 Essentially, each time you take on some cargo, that Cargo Bay (or whatever
 is being used) is roughly half-full; subsequent cargoes will have to fit
 in the remaining space, and once it's approximately full, you have to get
 rid of some cargo before you can take on more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The players then decide how valuable a cargo they want to acquire, by choosing
 the PL of the cargo.
 They roll their chosen Ability, plus any help from Combining, vs.
 the PL of the cargo; if they beat the cargo's PL, then some is available
 for sale.
 The asking price is the
\emph on
 lower
\emph default
 of the cargo's two die rolls: i.e.
 if the cargo is rolling d6 and d4, and the d6 comes up 3 and the d4 comes
 up 4, the asking price is 3.
 If the players find that acceptable, they've taken on the cargo, and they
 record the cargo and the price they paid.
 Whether the succeed, fail, or they don't like the asking price, the presumption
 is that they've explored their options and there are no better deals to
 be had; they must either travel elsewhere or spend 
\series bold
3
\series default
 Scenes on unrelated matters before they can try again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characters must always sell cargoes some place other than where they
 picked them up.
 When they want to sell, they roll 
\emph on
the cargo's
\emph default
 Power Level vs.
 the roll of the Wealth Level of the locale set by the GM.
 If they beat that Wealth roll, then they find a buyer for that cargo, and
 the Wealth roll is the best offer they've gotten.
 If that is acceptable to them, they unload the cargo, and the profit (or
 loss) is WP equal to the difference between that sale price and their previousl
y recorded purchase price.
 If they don't have WP to cover the loss and still want the trade, for instance
 because they've been trying to unload it forever without success and they
 really need the space back, their Wealth Level is knocked down by 1.
 Again, the presumption is that's the best deal they have for selling any
 of their cargo in that location, and they will have to travel elsewhere
 or spend 3 Scenes on unrelated matters before attempting to sell another
 cargo, or that cargo again if they didn't like the offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this boils down to is that really valuable (high PL) cargoes are easy
 to find buyers for, but poor locations (low WL) won't be able to offer
 very much wealth for them.
 Wealthy locations will tend to purchase cargo at a much higher price, but
 because they're wealthy it will be harder to sell them cheap (low PL) goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Star Trader Falk wants to see if he can pick up some cargo on Ytter.
 He has a trade-ship with Cargo Bays 7.
 He'd like to get something he can sell quickly, so he doesn't want to try
 for too expensive a cargo, both because it might not be available and it
 might be too hard to unload at a good price in this relatively poor section
 of the frontier, so he announces he wants to pick up a cargo of PL 4 Ytterian
 otterlusk furs, using his Cargo Bay and aiding it with his Merchant Shtick.
 (He just made up otterlusks and the value of their fur, as part of the
 Primary Rule.) He rolls a d8, d6 and gets a 3 +1 for Merchant, totaling
 4.
 The otterlusk furs roll a d4, d4 and get a 4 and a 4, so he can pick them
 up at price 4.
 That's higher than ideal, since he'll need the purchaser to roll higher
 than 4 to make a profit, so he passes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spends the next 3 Scenes making repairs on the ship's sensors, getting
 in a poker match in a saloon, and training with his crew, and decides to
 try one more deal before giving up and leaving the planet with empty holds.
 He tries for a cargo of exotic hardwood PL 5 this time, using the same
 powers and shticks, and rolls a 2, +1 for 3.
 Fortunately the hardwood cargo rolls a 2 and a 1, so he gets it for a bargain
 price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After traveling to nearby Klopor for reasons having to do with the adventure
 they're on, he tries to unload the cargo.
 The GM rules that Klopor is a Wealth 4 planet.
 He rolls the cargo's PL of 5, and gets a 5, +1 for Merchant, for a total
 of 6.
 The Kloporians will definitely want that cargo (since they can't possibly
 roll higher than that), but how much will they offer? The GM rolls a 2
 for the Kloporians.
 That would be only 1 WP profit (selling price of 2 - purchase price back
 on Ytter of 1), so Falk refuses the deal.
 Having purchased it for 1, he's sure he can do better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since he still has room in the Cargo Bay, he decides to try to take on another
 cargo.
 He announces he's trying to get some Kloporian machine parts at PL 6.
 Since the ship's Cargo Bay power is Hindered by being partially full of
 hardwood, it will only roll a single d6, plus +1 for Falk's Merchant Shtick.
 He gets Xark, the ship's engineer, to Combine his Engineering Power with
 the roll, since Engineers understand machines.
 They roll a 4 +1 +1, for a total of 6.
 The machine parts cargo will definitely be available, but for how much?
 The GM rolls a 6 and a 2...
 just barely available, but at a decent price.
 Falk takes on the cargo, and now the Cargo Bays are full; if he wants to
 do more Trading he'll have to use a different ship's Power or unload one
 of the cargo's first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next stop on the adventure is the wealthy planet Hopalong (Wealth 8).
 It'll be harder for their PL 5 cargo to beat that, so another player's
 character, Vira, offers to aid using her Streetwise Shtick for another
 +1, saying the importation of hardwoods faces a high tariff so they try
 the black market.
 Falk rolls a 5 for the cargo, +1 for Merchant, +1 for Vira's Streetwise,
 totaling 7.
 The GM rolls a d8, d8, and gets a 6 for the Hopalong buyers.
 Falk takes the deal, and makes a profit of 5 WP, halfway to the next Wealth
 Level! The WP are at the ship's Scope, since it's the ship's Cargo Bay
 power that was being used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wants to unload the Machine Parts, too, so they spend another 3 Scenes
 on Hopalong, but using the Machine Parts cargo PL 6 only rolls a 1 +1 +1
 (using his Merchant and Xark's Engineering to help again) for a 3; Hopalong
 rolls a 6, and the wealthy residents turn up their noses at the cargo.
 Falk and co.
 will have to try again somewhere else...
