# The Initial Attack

The Mysterian attack on The Aphrodite's Pearl liner wasn't random - they were specifically targeting the ship to capture it intact (before the crew's resistance forced more drastic measures). This uncharacteristic inner-system attack has raised alarms throughout the Solar System.

## The Missing Mysterians

When your players investigate (either through their own initiative or official channels), they discover a crucial anomaly:

* Highport's observatory tracked the attacking vessels entering Venus's atmosphere rather than departing the system
* Deep-space monitoring stations report no Mysterian craft leaving Venus's vicinity after the attack
* This breaks the established pattern of Mysterian "hit-and-run" tactics observed for decades

## Investigation Threads

### Highport Observatory

From the observatory's tracking data, players could determine:

* The Mysterian craft descended to specific coordinates in Venus's equatorial oceans
* The craft appeared to utilize a unique orbital approach that minimized visibility
* Previous similar descent patterns were misclassified as instrument errors

### Victoria Colonial Records

In Victoria's archives, they might discover:

* A classified 1997 report detailing the recovery of an unusual submersible craft with breathing liquid technology
* The expedition team that investigated disappeared shortly after filing their initial findings
* The recovered technology influenced early Endural development before the connection was classified

### Port Charles Rumors

From dockworkers and fringe elements in Port Charles:

* Stories of "ghost ships" that emerge from the ocean during severe storms
* Salvagers who disappeared while investigating certain deep-water wrecks
* Unusual equipment sometimes recovered from the depths that's quickly confiscated by authorities

### Nimbus City Scientific Anomalies

Researchers in Nimbus City have noted:

* Inexplicable atmospheric composition changes originating from the oceans
* Periodic electromagnetic disturbances that align with Mysterian activity patterns
* Weather pattern manipulations that create "blind spots" over certain ocean regions

## Revelation Path

As players follow these threads, they could ultimately:

1. **Acquire Coordinates** - Pinpoint the approximate location of underwater Mysterian activity
2. **Discover Entryways** - Learn of natural formations or abandoned research facilities that provide access
3. **Obtain Technology** - Find or develop technology that allows them to survive in the hyper-oxygenated liquid environment
4. **Infiltrate Deep Haven** - Enter the hidden Mysterian base, perhaps initially mistaken for captives
5. **Uncover the Truth** - Learn that Venus has been a long-term Mysterian staging area, not just a recent target

## The Bigger Mystery

The ultimate revelation could be that the Mysterians aren't just using Venus as a convenient hiding place - they're specifically interested in:

* The Forerunner technology unique to Venus's underwater ruins
* Biological adaptations possible in Venus's environment that they need for their own purposes
* A long-term plan to use Venus as a staging area for a larger invasion

This approach creates a compelling investigation that builds directly from the players' crash-landing experience while gradually uncovering a much larger threat. It positions Deep Haven as a major revelation rather than a known location, making its discovery a dramatic turning point in your campaign.

Would you like me to develop any particular aspect of this mystery further? Perhaps specific clues they might find at each location, or the exact nature of what the Mysterians are doing beneath Venus's oceans?
