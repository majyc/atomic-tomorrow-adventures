### The Endural Factor

Endural, a medication derived from native Venusian plant compounds, has revolutionized human habitation on Venus. This daily pill allows humans to withstand the increasing atmospheric pressure of the lowlands without bulky pressure suits. The discovery of this compound in the 1990s led to a colonization boom across previously inaccessible regions.

Endural works by:

* Reinforcing cellular structures to resist crushing pressures
* Enhancing oxygen absorption efficiency in CO2-rich atmospheres
* Stabilizing the nervous system against pressure-related symptoms
* Providing limited protection against heat in lower elevations

Side effects include a slight greenish tint to the skin and enhanced night vision - traits that have become markers of "true Venusians" who have lived on the planet for generations.
