# Research Card System v2.0

## Overview

The Research Card System v2.0 addresses the "dead card" problem while creating meaningful strategic choices for players. Instead of drawing cards one at a time until finding a matching suit, the GM reveals multiple options and creates hidden alternative tracks.

## Core Mechanics

### Setup
- Standard 52-card deck
- Four research approaches (suits): Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades
- Each suit represents a different research methodology
- Resource types correspond to suits for acceleration

### Basic Flow

1. **Initial Draw**: GM draws cards until one matches the current research approach (suit)
2. **Hidden Track Creation**: Non-matching cards are placed face-down in separate rows by suit
3. **Player Choice**: Player decides between:
   - Working on the revealed matching card
   - Exploring a hidden track (switching to that approach for this turn), or resuming a partially completed track exposed before.
4. **Track Selection**: When choosing a hidden track, GM flips the top card face-up, the researchers must finish that card before they can switch.
5. **Completion**: Research continues until threshold is met and any Ace is drawn
6. **Cleanup**: Unused face-down cards go to bottom of deck

### Difficulty Thresholds

Research projects have announced minimum card values required before an Ace can complete the research:

- **Routine (3-4)**: Basic research, almost guaranteed success
- **Moderate (5-6)**: Standard difficulty, likely but not certain success  
- **Hard (7-8)**: Challenging research, real risk of hitting Ace first
- **Extreme (9-10)**: Cutting-edge research, Ace quite possible before threshold

### Special Cards

- **Ace**: Completes research if threshold has been met; forces continuation if not
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Special events or complications (GM discretion)
- **Number Cards**: Progress toward threshold, with suit-specific resource spending for acceleration

### Resource Acceleration

Players can spend suit-appropriate resources to complete cards faster:
- **Hearts**: Time, patience, careful observation
- **Diamonds**: Money, equipment, materials
- **Clubs**: Connections, favors, social resources
- **Spades**: Risk-taking, direct action, bold moves

## Strategic Considerations

### Track Management
- **Visible tracks**: Known difficulty, predictable progression
- **Hidden tracks**: Unknown difficulty, potential shortcuts or traps
- **Approach flexibility**: Players can switch between visible and hidden options each turn based on revealed cards

### Resource Economics
- Early resource spending vs. saving for emergencies
- Suit-matching efficiency (spending Hearts resources on Hearts cards)
- Risk assessment of threshold vs. current progress

### Timing Decisions
- When to abandon a difficult visible card for unknown alternatives
- Balancing progress speed against resource conservation
- Managing deck depletion effects (later draws less likely to match preferred suits)

## Example Session

**Setup**: Hard research project (threshold 8), starting with Hearts approach
**Starting resources**: 3 Hearts, 2 Diamonds, 1 Club, 2 Spades

**Turn 1**: GM draws 4♦, 7♣, 9♥
- Places 4♦ and 7♣ face-down in their respective suit rows
- Reveals 9♥ as current option
- Player sees 9 > 8 threshold and chooses to work on it
- Rolls well, completes quickly without resources

**Turn 2**: GM draws until Hearts found: 2♠, K♣, 6♥
- 2♠ goes to Spades row, K♣ goes to Clubs row (special event noted)
- 6♥ revealed as current option
- Player considers: known 6 vs. hidden alternatives
- Chooses to explore Diamonds row, GM flips 4♦
- Player switches to Diamonds approach for this card

**Turn 3**: Player works on 4♦, spends 1 Diamond resource to accelerate, completes card
**Turn 4**: GM draws next card set, player can choose any available approach
- GM draws A♦ - research complete!

## Simulation Parameters

### Player Strategies
1. **Conservative**: Always take visible cards, spend resources liberally
2. **Aggressive**: Explore hidden tracks when visible card >6, minimal resource spending
3. **Balanced**: Mix of approaches based on current situation
4. **Resource-Heavy**: Always spend resources when available
5. **Threshold-Focused**: Only work on cards that meet/exceed threshold

### Measured Outcomes
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of research projects completed successfully
- **Average Duration**: Turns needed to complete research
- **Resource Cost**: Average resources spent per completed project
- **Failure Rate**: Percentage of projects abandoned or failed
- **Deck Depletion Effects**: How strategy effectiveness changes as deck composition shifts

### Variables to Test
- Different difficulty thresholds (3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10)
- Various starting resource pools
- Multiple research project lengths
- Different deck compositions and shuffle frequencies
