# VENUS AERIAL ADVENTURES

## AIRCRAFT TYPES & THEIR DISTINCTIVE TRAITS

Each aircraft type has unique capabilities without needing complex modifiers - just distinctive strengths and weaknesses that create meaningful choices.

### FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT

*The dependable workhorses of Venusian skies*

* **STRENGTHS** : Speed, range, passenger/cargo capacity
* **WEAKNESSES** : Needs clearing for takeoff/landing, less maneuverable in dense jungle
* **SIGNATURE ABILITY** : "Full Throttle" - On any critical success (doubles under skill), can cut travel time by 25%
* **CRITICAL FAILURE** : "Control Surface Damage" - On critical failure, aircraft becomes increasingly difficult to control until repaired

 **NOTABLE MODELS** :

* **Condor-class Transport** : Twin-engine workhorse connecting major settlements
* **Dragonfly Scout** : Lightweight reconnaissance craft with folding wings for compact storage
* **Neptune Amphibian** : Specialized for water landings in Venus's numerous swamps and lakes

### ROTARY-WING AIRCRAFT

*Perfect for jungle exploration and extraction missions*

* **STRENGTHS** : Vertical takeoff/landing, hovering capability, precise maneuvering
* **WEAKNESSES** : Limited range, higher fuel consumption, more maintenance
* **SIGNATURE ABILITY** : "Perfect Hover" - On any special success (roll ending in 0 or 5), gain +20% to any action performed while hovering
* **CRITICAL FAILURE** : "Rotor Stress" - On critical failure, must land within 10 minutes or risk catastrophic failure

 **NOTABLE MODELS** :

* **Jungle Queen** : Heavy-lift model with reinforced underbelly for canopy extractions
* **Hummingbird** : Ultra-maneuverable single-seat scout with transparent bubble canopy
* **Skyhook** : Military variant with specialized winch system for retrieving personnel/cargo

### LIGHTER-THAN-AIR CRAFT

*The majestic nomads of Venus's sky*

* **STRENGTHS** : Endurance, stability, fuel efficiency, comfort
* **WEAKNESSES** : Slow speed, vulnerability to storms, large target profile
* **SIGNATURE ABILITY** : "Thermal Riding" - On any special success, can travel for 12 hours without fuel consumption
* **CRITICAL FAILURE** : "Envelope Breach" - On critical failure, begins losing altitude and must be repaired before catastrophic failure

 **NOTABLE MODELS** :

* **Cloud Drifter** : Luxury passenger vessel with observation lounges
* **Nomad Caravan** : Self-sufficient research platform for extended expeditions
* **Sky Harvester** : Specialized collection vessel for gathering rare high-altitude flora

## SIMPLIFIED FLIGHT RESOLUTION

### BASIC FLIGHT CHECK

Roll against **Piloting (appropriate type)** with minimal modifiers:

* Standard flight: No modifiers
* Challenging conditions (storms, darkness): -20%
* Extreme conditions (severe storms, emergency): -40%

### SITUATION-BASED CHALLENGES

Rather than having modifiers for different atmospheric zones, create specific challenge scenarios that occur during adventures:

#### CANOPY THREADING

*Navigate through the dense jungle canopy to reach a hidden location*

* Roll Piloting (rotary-wing preferred)
* **Ordinary Success** : Safely navigate through the canopy
* **Special Success** : Discover an ideal landing spot near objective
* **Critical Success** : Notice something valuable/important others would miss
* **Failure** : Minor course deviation, try again
* **Special Failure** : Minor collision with branches/wildlife
* **Critical Failure** : Major collision, emergency landing required

#### STORM EVASION

*A massive storm system threatens your aircraft*

* Roll Piloting (any)
* **Ordinary Success** : Navigate around or through the storm safely
* **Special Success** : Find a gap that allows you to maintain course without delay
* **Critical Success** : Discover calm "eye" with perfect visibility and unique observation opportunity
* **Failure** : Forced to divert, adding time to journey
* **Special Failure** : Caught in turbulence, passengers must make GRIT checks
* **Critical Failure** : Severe damage from turbulence, emergency landing required

#### SWAMP LANDING

*Set down safely in Venus's treacherous lowland swamps*

* Roll Piloting (amphibious fixed-wing or rotary-wing)
* **Ordinary Success** : Safe landing on relatively solid ground
* **Special Success** : Find exceptional landing spot with good visibility and security
* **Critical Success** : Discover a hidden feature (ancient ruins, rare specimen, etc.)
* **Failure** : Rough landing, minor stress to aircraft
* **Special Failure** : Land in unstable area, aircraft slowly sinking
* **Critical Failure** : Land in dangerous area with immediate threats (predators, quicksand, etc.)

## THE ENDURAL FACTOR

Pilots taking Endural have a unique relationship with Venus's atmosphere:

* Can sense upcoming weather patterns before instruments detect them
* Experience vivid clarity of vision in Venus's perpetual mist
* On any roll showing doubles (whether success or failure), experience brief but vivid hallucinations that reveal something unexpected about the environment

## AERIAL ENCOUNTERS

### FLOATY GASBAGS

*Massive, gentle filter-feeders drifting in Venus's upper atmosphere*

* Generally harmless unless startled
* Can be safely navigated around with successful Piloting check
* On critical failure: Collision causes minor damage but major gas release (potentially beneficial as emergency lift)

### HUNTING FLYERS

*Predatory creatures that attack in coordinated packs*

* Require evasive maneuvers (Piloting at -20%)
* On special success: Spectacular evasion that becomes a tale told in pilot lounges
* On critical failure: Creatures damage control surfaces or puncture gas envelope

### LIVING CLOUDS

*Collective organisms that appear as colorful mist formations*

* Usually docile unless threatened
* On special success: Pilot navigates close enough for passengers to witness bioluminescent display
* On failure: Aircraft enters cloud, experiencing mild electrical interference
* On critical failure: Aircraft triggers defense mechanism (acid spray, electrical discharge)

## ADVENTURE HOOKS

1. **THE LOST EXPEDITION**
   *A research airship has gone missing in an unexplored region. The characters must navigate treacherous weather patterns to locate potential survivors.*
2. **EMERGENCY EXTRACTION**
   *A valuable scientist is stranded at a remote research site as a massive storm approaches. Only a skilled rotary-wing pilot can thread through the jungle canopy for a rescue.*
3. **THE CLOUD CITY RACE**
   *An annual competition tests pilots' skills as they navigate a course between Venus's floating habitats and natural obstacles. Fame, fortune, and valuable contracts await the winner.*
4. **AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY MISSION**
   *A scientific foundation needs high-resolution images of a newly discovered species of flying creature. The catch? They only appear during the most dangerous storm conditions.*
5. **THE NOMAD RENDEZVOUS**
   *The characters must intercept a Cloud Drifter Nomad vessel that follows no fixed schedule or route, relying on observational skills and local knowledge to predict its path.*

This system maintains the pulp-adventure feel while eliminating the complexity of multiple modifiers. Each aircraft type has distinctive capabilities that create meaningful choices without requiring players to track numerous environmental modifiers. The encounter-based approach integrates the flying challenges directly into adventures rather than making them separate mechanical considerations.

How does this revised approach align with your vision for Atomic Tomorrow's Venus?
