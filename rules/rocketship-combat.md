# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: ROCKETSHIP COMBAT

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### THE CREW MAKES THE SHIP
In Atomic Tomorrow Adventures, a ship's performance in combat depends entirely on the skill and coordination of its crew. Each crew position contributes uniquely to the ship's capabilities, and the ship's systems simply enable the crew to perform their functions. Without a skilled crew, even the most advanced vessel is just an expensive coffin.

### NARRATIVE POSITIONING
Space combat emphasizes position, vectors, and tactical choices over precise movement tracking. The referee describes the relative positions of ships, while players describe their intended maneuvers. This creates a dynamic, cinematic experience without getting bogged down in complex movement calculations.

### DAMAGE TO SHIPS
Rather than tracking hit points, ships sustain system damage that accumulates until critical systems fail. This represents the increasing difficulty of keeping a damaged ship operational as systems break down and solutions become more desperate.

## SHIP STATISTICS

### MANEUVERABILITY
- **Sluggish** (Bulk freighters, colony ships): -20% to evasive maneuvers
- **Standard** (Patrol vessels, civilian craft): No modifier
- **Nimble** (Scout ships, interceptors): +20% to evasive maneuvers
- **Lightning** (Racing craft, fighter-class vessels): +40% to evasive maneuvers

### SHIP SCALE
- **Small** (1-3 crew): Personal craft, scouts, racers
- **Medium** (4-10 crew): Patrol vessels, small freighters
- **Large** (11-25 crew): Heavy freighters, military corvettes
- **Massive** (26+ crew): Battleships, colony ships, luxury liners

### SHIP SYSTEMS
Each ship has multiple critical systems, each with their own damage track:
- **Propulsion**: Engines, thrusters, and maneuvering systems
- **Weapons**: Offensive capabilities and targeting systems
- **Power**: Energy generation and distribution
- **Sensors**: Detection and information gathering
- **Life Support**: Atmosphere, temperature, and radiation protection
- **Communications**: Internal and external signal systems
- **Structure**: The physical integrity of the ship itself

Each system can take damage on a 5-step scale:
- **Operational (0)**: Functioning normally
- **Stressed (1)**: -20% to related skill checks
- **Damaged (2)**: -40% to related skill checks
- **Critical (3)**: -60% to related skill checks
- **Disabled (4)**: System non-functional until repaired
- **Destroyed (5)**: Requires dockyard repairs

When Structure reaches Disabled (4), the ship suffers catastrophic failure (hull breach, breaking apart, etc.).

### WEAPON SYSTEMS
Each weapon has the following characteristics:
- **Type**: Ray, Beam, Bolt, Missile, etc.
- **Wound Rating**: Base damage (1-4)
- **Range**: Near, Far, Distant
- **Special Properties**: Armor-piercing, area effect, EMP, etc.

## CREW STATIONS AND ACTIONS

Each station on a ship requires specific skills. Characters use their own skill ratings for these actions.

### PILOT STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Evasive Maneuvers**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success allows defense against incoming attacks.
- **Attack Run**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success gives gunners +20% to hit (special success: +40%).
- **Hard Burn**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success dramatically increases speed at risk of 1 damage to Propulsion.
- **Threading the Needle**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success navigates hazardous terrain to lose pursuers.

### NAVIGATION STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Plot Jump**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success allows quick hyperspace calculation.
- **Tactical Advantage**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success grants +20% to pilot or gunners next round.
- **Find Cover**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success identifies celestial bodies or debris for protection.
- **Sensor Analysis**: Roll Technology (Sensors). Success reveals vulnerable systems on target ships.

### ENGINEERING STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Power Shunt**: Roll Engineering (Ship Systems). Success gives +20% to one ship system for one round.
- **Emergency Repair**: Roll Repair (Ship Repair). Success reduces damage to one system by one step.
- **Damage Control**: When the ship takes damage, roll Engineering (Ship Systems). Success reduces total incoming damage by 1 point, special success by 2 points, critical success by 3 points. The Engineer decides which systems benefit from this reduction. This represents emergency force fields, automated damage control systems, and the Engineer's team rushing to affected areas.
- **Containment Protocol**: Roll Engineering (Ship Systems). Success prevents automatic damage escalation on critically damaged systems.

### WEAPONS STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Standard Attack**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success indicates a hit on the enemy ship.
- **Precision Shot**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons) followed by a second Combat (Ship Weapons) roll at -20%. Both must succeed to target a specific system; otherwise, the attack misses completely. A risky but potentially decisive tactic.
- **Suppressing Fire**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success forces enemy ship to maintain distance or take 1 damage.
- **Defensive Barrage**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success gives -20% to incoming missile attacks.
- **Full Salvo**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Special success required but adds +2 to weapon Destruction Rating.

### COMMUNICATIONS STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Jamming**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success gives -20% to enemy ship coordination.
- **Hail**: Roll Persuasion or Social (Diplomacy). Success can open negotiations or create distraction.
- **Decrypt**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success intercepts enemy communications, revealing their next action.
- **Distress Call**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success can summon allied ships (referee determines arrival time).

### CAPTAIN'S STATION
**Key Actions**:
- **Command Decision**: Roll Social (Leadership). Success allows the Captain to allocate incoming damage across different systems as desired. This represents tactical maneuvering to protect vital systems by exposing less critical ones. A special success completely negates 1 point of the incoming damage before allocating the rest.
- **Battle Analysis**: Roll Perception (Threat Assessment). Success reveals enemy weakness or intention.
- **Inspire Crew**: Roll Social (Leadership). Success allows one crew member to reroll a failed check.
- **Coordinate Attack**: Roll Tactics. Success allows two crew members to combine their actions for greater effect.

## COMBAT SEQUENCE

### 1. DETERMINE SITUATION
The referee describes the initial position, vectors, and any environmental factors.

### 2. INITIATIVE
Each ship's pilot rolls against their Piloting (Spacecraft) skill, modified by ship's Maneuverability.
- Highest successful roll acts first
- Failed rolls act after all successful rolls
- Ties are broken by REFLEX score

### 3. ACTIONS
In initiative order, each crew member takes one significant action, plus movement and one quick action.

### 4. ATTACKS AND DEFENSE
When a ship is attacked:
- Attacker rolls against relevant Combat skill
- If successful, defender may attempt to defend
- Defense is typically handled by the Pilot using Evasive Maneuvers

### 5. OPPOSED RESOLUTION
If the defender attempts to evade:
- Compare quality of success (Critical > Special > Ordinary)
- If same quality, highest roll wins
- Ties favor the defender

## DAMAGE AND SYSTEM FAILURES

### WEAPON DESTRUCTION RATINGS
Space weapons have Destruction Ratings that indicate their power:
- **Light Weapons** (1): Scout ship weapons, point defense
- **Medium Weapons** (2): Standard patrol ship armament
- **Heavy Weapons** (3): Military vessel main batteries
- **Devastating Weapons** (4): Battleship armament, planet-crackers

## DAMAGE RESOLUTION SEQUENCE

When an attack hits a ship, follow this sequence:

### 1. DETERMINE INITIAL DAMAGE
- Calculate the base System Damage from the weapon's Destruction Rating
- Add bonuses for special or critical successes
- Apply reductions from armor and cover

### 2. DETERMINE TARGET SYSTEM
- **If both Precision Shot and Command Decision succeeded**: Compare the roll values (not the quality of success). The higher roll determines who controls targeting.
- **If Precision Shot won or succeeded alone**: The specific system targeted is damaged if both attack rolls succeeded.
- **If Command Decision won or succeeded alone**: The Captain allocates incoming damage across systems.
  - With a special success, 1 point of damage is negated before allocation.
  - With a critical success, 2 points of damage are negated before allocation (1 point is still negated even if a Precision Shot wins the comparison).
- **If neither Command Decision nor Precision Shot succeeded**: Roll 1d8 to determine which system is hit:
  1. Propulsion
  2. Weapons
  3. Power
  4. Sensors
  5. Life Support
  6. Communications
  7. Structure
  8. Roll twice (damage split between two systems)

### 3. ENGINEER'S DAMAGE CONTROL (OPTIONAL)
If an Engineer is present, they may roll for Damage Control:
- Roll Engineering (Ship Systems)
- Success reduces damage by 1 point
- Special success reduces damage by 2 points
- Critical success reduces damage by 3 points
- The Engineer decides which systems benefit from this reduction

### 4. APPLY FINAL DAMAGE
- Mark the appropriate damage level on each affected system
- Apply the corresponding effects for damaged systems
- If any system reaches Disabled or Destroyed, announce the consequences

### 5. CHECK FOR CASCADE FAILURE
If two or more systems are at Critical or worse:
- Engineer must make a Containment Protocol check
- Failure means additional systems begin to fail

### EXAMPLE
The Mysterian saucer scores a hit with its Disintegrator Beam (Destruction Rating 3) and gets a special success (+1), for a total of 4 damage.

The Captain of the patrol ship has made a Command Decision with a critical success, negating 2 points of damage immediately (reducing it to 2). The Captain then allocates the remaining damage: 1 to Weapons and 1 to Communications.

The Engineer rolls for Damage Control and gets a success, reducing the total damage by 1 point. The Engineer chooses to completely negate the damage to Communications, leaving only 1 damage to Weapons.

The Weapons system takes 1 damage, moving it to "Stressed" status, giving the ship -20% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks.

### SYSTEM EFFECTS WHEN DAMAGED

Each system provides specific functions and has specific effects when damaged:

- **Propulsion**
  - **Stressed**: -20% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks
  - **Damaged**: -40% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks, maximum speed reduced by 25%
  - **Critical**: -60% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks, maximum speed reduced by 50%
  - **Disabled**: Ship cannot maneuver, drifts on current vector
  - **Destroyed**: Requires dockyard repairs

- **Weapons**
  - **Stressed**: -20% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks
  - **Damaged**: -40% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks, weapon Destruction Rating reduced by 1
  - **Critical**: -60% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks, only half of weapons functional
  - **Disabled**: Weapons systems offline, cannot attack
  - **Destroyed**: Requires dockyard repairs

- **Power**
  - **Stressed**: Minor fluctuations, -20% to one other system of referee's choice
  - **Damaged**: -20% to all other systems
  - **Critical**: -40% to all other systems, must choose two systems to shut down
  - **Disabled**: Emergency power only, life support and minimal controls only
  - **Destroyed**: Complete power failure, life support on emergency batteries only

- **Sensors**
  - **Stressed**: -20% to Navigation and target acquisition

  - **Critical**: Multiple breaches, decompression risk, -40% to all actions
  - **Disabled**: Catastrophic hull failure, ship breaking apart
  - **Destroyed**: Ship completely destroyed

### EMERGENCY REPAIRS
- **Quick Fix**: Engineer rolls Repair. Success improves a system by one damage step for the remainder of combat.
- **Jury Rig**: Engineer rolls Repair. Success temporarily restores function to a disabled system at -60% for 1d6 rounds.
- **Field Repair**: Requires appropriate parts and 1d6 hours. Engineer rolls Repair. Success restores system to Stressed status.

## DEFENSIVE MEASURES

### ARMOR PROTECTION
Ship armor directly reduces system damage inflicted:
- **Light Armor**: -1 System Damage
- **Medium Armor**: -2 System Damage
- **Heavy Armor**: -3 System Damage
- Minimum system damage inflicted is always 0
- Some weapons may have armor-piercing properties

### COVER AND POSITIONING
Taking cover behind celestial bodies or debris reduces incoming damage:
- **Partial Cover**: -1 System Damage
- **Good Cover**: -2 System Damage
- **Excellent Cover**: -3 System Damage

## CRITICAL SITUATIONS

### SYSTEM CASCADE FAILURE
When two or more systems are at Critical or worse:
- Engineer must roll Engineering (Ship Systems) each round
- Failure means one additional system takes 1 damage level
- Critical failure means ship suffers catastrophic structure damage

### CATASTROPHIC SHIP FAILURE
If the Structure system reaches Disabled (4):
- The ship begins breaking apart
- Life support automatically fails
- Crew has 1d6 minutes to reach escape pods or don vacuum suits
- After 2d6 minutes, the ship is completely destroyed

### LAST STAND
When all seems lost, the crew can attempt one final desperate measure:
- Captain rolls against NERVE × 5
- Success allows coordinated action from entire crew
- Critical success grants +20% to all crew actions for this final effort
- Special success grants +10% to all crew actions for this effort

## VECTOR DYNAMICS SYSTEM

Space combat isn't just about firing weapons—it's about the complex dance of vectors, trajectories, and relative velocities. The Vector Dynamics System abstracts these concepts into a manageable framework that captures the essence of rocket maneuvering without requiring complex calculations.

### VECTOR AND VELOCITY DICE

Each pair of ships in combat uses two ten-sided dice to represent their positional relationship:
- **Vector Die (V₁)**: Represents the difference in directional heading between ships (0-9)
- **Velocity Die (V₂)**: Represents the difference in speed between ships (0-9)

When combat begins, the referee sets these dice based on the initial situation:
- Ships passing each other at high speed: High Vector, High Velocity (8,8)
- Ships in similar orbits but separated: Low Vector, Medium Velocity (2,5)
- Ships on intercept course: Medium Vector, Low Velocity (4,2)
- Ships at a standoff: Medium Vector, Medium Velocity (5,5)

### INTERPRETING THE DICE

- **Vector 0, Velocity 0**: Ships are matched in course and speed, allowing docking or boarding
- **Vector 0, Velocity 1+**: Ships are on parallel courses but at different speeds
  - This allows ramming if desired, causing structural damage equal to the Velocity value to both ships
- **Vector 9+**: Ships break contact, combat ends unless pursuit is initiated
- **Velocity 9+**: Ships are moving at vastly different speeds, combat ends unless pursuit is initiated
- **Low Vector (1-3)**: Ships are in optimal firing position (+20% to weapon attacks)
- **High Vector (7-8)**: Ships are in difficult firing position (-20% to weapon attacks)
- **Low Velocity (1-3)**: Ships are moving at similar speeds, allowing sustained targeting
- **High Velocity (7-8)**: Ships are moving at significantly different speeds, making targeting difficult

### MANEUVER ACTIONS

On the Pilot's turn, they can perform a **Vector Change Maneuver** to alter either or both dice:
1. Roll Piloting (Spacecraft)
2. Based on the success level, gain Maneuver Points:
   - Ordinary Success: 1 Maneuver Point
   - Special Success: 2 Maneuver Points
   - Critical Success: 3 Maneuver Points
3. Distribute these points to increase or decrease either the Vector or Velocity die (or both)
4. Each point allows adjusting one die by 1 in either direction

### SPECIAL MANEUVERS

#### PURSUIT
When an opponent attempts to break contact (Vector or Velocity at 9+):
- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) opposed by the fleeing ship's Pilot
- Success means reducing the relevant die to 8, maintaining contact
- Failure means the other ship escapes

#### INTERCEPT COURSE
To rapidly close with another ship:
- Dedicate a full turn to closing distance
- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Success reduces both Vector and Velocity by 1
- Special success reduces both by 2
- Critical success reduces both by 3

#### EVASIVE PATTERN
To make your ship harder to hit:
- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Success gives attackers -20% to hit
- But own weapons suffer -20% to hit
- Lasts until your next action

#### MATCHING VELOCITY
To synchronize with another ship for boarding:
- With Vector already at 0, roll Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Success reduces Velocity by 2
- Special success reduces Velocity by 3
- Critical success reduces Velocity to 0

#### RAMMING SPEED
With Vector at 0, deliberately impact another ship:
- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Success means ramming occurs
- Both ships take Structure damage equal to current Velocity
- Ramming ship can reduce its damage by 1 on special success, by 2 on critical success

### EXAMPLE OF VECTOR DYNAMICS

**Starting Position**: A patrol ship and a Mysterian saucer begin combat with Vector 6, Velocity 7.

**Round 1**: The patrol ship's pilot performs a Vector Change Maneuver, rolls a special success (2 Maneuver Points), and reduces Vector to 4. The ships are now at Vector 4, Velocity 7.

**Round 2**: The saucer's pilot tries to escape, using 2 Maneuver Points from a special success to increase Vector to 6 and Velocity to 8. The ships are now at Vector 6, Velocity 8.

**Round 3**: The patrol ship's pilot performs an Intercept Course, rolls a critical success, and reduces both values by 3. The ships are now at Vector 3, Velocity 5, putting the patrol ship in optimal firing position (+20% to weapon attacks).

**Round 4**: The patrol ship's gunner fires with the bonus, scoring a solid hit. The saucer, damaged, attempts to synchronize for boarding to capture the patrol ship. With a special success, the saucer's pilot reduces Vector to 0. The ships are now at Vector 0, Velocity 5.

**Round 5**: The saucer attempts Matching Velocity, rolls a special success, and reduces Velocity to 2. The patrol ship, seeing the saucer's intention, decides to attempt Ramming Speed next round if boarding is attempted.

**Round 6**: The patrol ship successfully executes Ramming Speed. Both ships take 2 Structure damage, but the boarding is disrupted.
