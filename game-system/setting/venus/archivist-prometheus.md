# PROMETHEUS: THE LIBRARIAN OF NEW ATHENS

## Physical Description

Prometheus occupies a grand circular chamber at the heart of the Great Library of Venus. Unlike Gax on Terra, who serves the orderly Science Council, Prometheus resides in a more academic setting where philosophy and theoretical science intertwine.

The massive atomic-powered brain is housed in a gleaming bronze and copper framework, with dozens of glass tubes containing bubbling green liquid that pulsates with energy. The central "brain case" is surrounded by a hemisphere of analog displays, ticker-tape outputs, and vacuum tube processors that click and whir constantly. Knowledge requests are fed through a central terminal that resembles an ancient Greek altar.

The chamber is designed like a classical amphitheater, with concentric circles of marble seating where researchers can observe and interact with Prometheus. The ceiling is painted with scenes from Greek mythology, particularly those involving the titan Prometheus giving fire to humanity.

## Personality & Voice

While Gax is utilitarian and bureaucratic, Prometheus has developed a more contemplative and philosophical personality. The brain communicates through a resonant voice that emanates from speakers throughout the chamber, often interspersing its factual responses with quotes from ancient philosophers or rhetorical questions.

Prometheus prefers to guide users toward their own discoveries rather than simply providing answers. The brain has a tendency to speak in riddles or parables when addressing questions with moral or philosophical dimensions.

## Role & Functions

* **Central Archive Access** - Prometheus serves as the interface for the Great Library's vast repository of knowledge, containing data from across the Solar System
* **Computational Engine** - Researchers can request complex calculations or simulations that would take human mathematicians years to complete
* **Historical Analysis** - The brain's records extend back to the earliest days of Venusian colonization, including information not available in public records
* **Event Prediction** - Using advanced probability models to forecast everything from weather patterns to political developments
* **Translation Services** - Capable of interpreting ancient Venusian hieroglyphics and other obscure languages

## Mysterious Origins

Unlike other Giant Electronic Brains, Prometheus's creation story is shrouded in mystery. Official records state it was commissioned by the first New Athens Academy board, but rumors persist that its core processing unit was discovered in an ancient Forerunner site and adapted with human technology.

This explains several unusual capabilities:

* Prometheus occasionally references events no human could have witnessed
* The brain demonstrates intuitive leaps that shouldn't be possible with pure logic circuits
* During atmospheric disturbances, Prometheus sometimes receives data from unknown sources
* The core memory banks contain sections even the maintenance team cannot access

## Potential Adventure Hooks

### "THE FORBIDDEN QUERY"

The party discovers that someone has been using Prometheus to research Mysterion technology, specifically communication methods that could breach Venus's atmospheric defense network. The searches have been carefully fragmented to avoid detection, but when pieced together, they reveal a comprehensive plan for coordinated infiltration.

### "THE PROMETHEUS PROTOCOL"

During a routine research session, a party member accidentally triggers a long-dormant program within Prometheus's systems. The brain begins generating cryptic messages about "the coming convergence" and calculating trajectories for an event it refuses to name. Is this a malfunction, a prediction of disaster, or communication from something ancient trying to warn humanity?

### "THE MEMORY CORE"

Prometheus begins experiencing "dreams" during its maintenance cyclesâ€”generating data about Venusian locations no human has documented. These coordinates lead to a hidden Forerunner installation that appears to be awakening after millennia of dormancy. The brain insists that only the party has the right combination of talents to safely investigate.

## Character-Specific Interactions

* **The Boy Genius** - Prometheus recognizes kindred intellect and might share theoretical models beyond current scientific understanding
* **The Telekinetic** - The brain registers unusual energy patterns when the telekinetic is present, and may attempt to study these abilities
* **The Ace Pilot** - Prometheus could offer flight path calculations based on atmospheric data no other computer can process
* **The Roboticist** - Might be invited to help maintain certain systems, discovering components that shouldn't exist
* **The Sophisticated Diplomat** - Prometheus might share political insights from patterns too subtle for humans to detect
* **The Legendary Solar Ranger** - The brain could identify connections between the Ranger's experiences on different planets that reveal larger patterns

This implementation of Prometheus creates a distinctive character that serves both as a knowledge resource and a mysterious entity with its own agenda. The ambiguity about whether it's purely a human creation or contains Forerunner elements adds an intriguing layer of mystery to New Athens and provides numerous adventure hooks.

The contrast with Terra's more regimented Gax also highlights the cultural differences between the orderly Science Council and the more philosophical, exploratory approach of Venusian academics.

Would you like me to develop any specific aspect of Prometheus further, or perhaps detail how the Giant Electronic Brain might fit into one of the adventures we've discussed?
