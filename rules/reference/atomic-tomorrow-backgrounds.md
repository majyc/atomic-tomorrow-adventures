## Character Development Guidelines

### Combining Background with Other Elements

When selecting your background, consider how it interacts with your Epithet, Profession, and Origin:

- **Complementary Combinations**: Military Family + Grizzled Marine creates a character with exceptional combat effectiveness
- **Interesting Contrasts**: Academic + Two-Fisted Explorer creates a scholarly character with surprising physical prowess
- **Narrative Tension**: Street Urchin + Corporate Heir suggests a character with a complex, potentially hidden past

### Skill Integration

Your background skills combine with those from your profession and origin:

- When the same skill appears multiple times, add the bonuses together (up to a maximum of +60%)
- This creates natural specializations based on your character's complete history

### Resource and Connection Development

Work with your GM to establish specific NPCs and resources from your background:

- Name at least one important connection from your background
- Determine how your background resources manifest in play (specific knowledge, equipment, or social capital)

### Background Traits in Play

Your background trait represents instinctive knowledge or abilities gained through your upbringing:

- These apply automatically in appropriate situations
- They often provide special dice interpretations, similar to Epithets
