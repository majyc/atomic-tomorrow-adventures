# Atomic Tomorrow Adventures: Core System & Character Creation

## Core Resolution System

### Percentile Roll Mechanics

**Basic Resolution:**
- Roll d100 (two ten-sided dice, read as tens and ones)
- Roll under your skill or attribute percentage to succeed
- Higher skill percentages represent greater competence

**Special Results:**
- **Critical Success**: Any doubles (11, 22, etc.) that are below your skill/attribute
- **Fumble**: Any doubles that are above your skill/attribute
- **Special Effect**: Any successful roll ending in 0 or 5 (divisible by 5)
- **Automatic Success**: 05 or less (regardless of skill level)
- **Automatic Failure**: 96 or higher (even for masters)

**Opposed Checks:**
- Both participants roll percentile dice
- Highest successful roll wins (blackjack style - highest without going over your percentage)
- If both fail, higher roll still fails worse

### Attributes

Seven core attributes, ranging from 3-18 for normal humans:
- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, reaction speed
- **NERVE**: Mental composure, courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, craftiness

For attribute checks, multiply the attribute by 5 to get the target percentage.

### Derived Statistics
- **Hit Points** = BRAWN + GRIT
- **Mental Fortitude** = GRIT × 5 (for PSI defense)
- **Initiative** = REFLEX × 5

### PSI (Optional Attribute)
- Only for characters with psychic potential
- Used for psychic abilities and defense

## Character Creation Process

### Four-Column Selection System

Characters are created by selecting one option from each of four columns:

#### Column A: Epithet
*What makes you extraordinary*
- Examples: Two-Fisted, Grizzled, Brilliant, Lucky, Daring, etc.
- Provides special abilities and unique dice roll interpretations
- May grant attribute bonuses or skill advantages

#### Column B: Profession
*What you do*
- Examples: Scout, Scientist, Rocket Jockey, Smuggler, Patroller, etc.
- Determines primary skill set and equipment
- Provides professional knowledge and contacts

#### Column C: Origin
*Where you're from*
- Examples: Terran, Loonie, Venusian, Martian, Belter, etc.
- Grants origin-specific attribute modifiers and cultural skills
- Influences environmental adaptations and knowledge

#### Column D: Background
*Your upbringing or past*
- Examples: Military Family, Salaryman, Political Dynasty, Colonist, etc.
- Adds family/upbringing skills and social connections
- May provide additional resources or character traits

### Skill System

Skills are percentile-based, starting at:
- Base percentage = (Related attribute × 5)
- Professional training adds +20% to +40%
- Background skills typically add +10% to +20%
- Origin skills typically add +10% to +20%

Beginning characters should have competent skill levels between 25% and 80% depending on their natural talents and training.

### Character Advancement
- Characters gain +1d10% in skills used successfully during adventures
- Attributes may improve after significant milestones
- New skills can be learned at base level (attribute × 3%)
