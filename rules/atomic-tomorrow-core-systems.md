# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES
## CORE SYSTEM REFERENCE

*This document establishes the standardized mechanics used throughout Atomic Tomorrow Adventures. All subsystems build on these foundational principles.*

## CORE RESOLUTION MECHANIC

### Basic Resolution
- Roll percentile dice (d100) against your skill or attribute percentage
- Roll under your percentage to succeed
- Higher skill percentages represent greater competence

### Success Quality
- **Ordinary Success**: Roll under your skill percentage
- **Special Success**: Roll ending in 0 or 5 and under your skill percentage
- **Critical Success**: Matching doubles (11, 22, etc.) that are below your skill percentage
- **Automatic Success**: Roll of 01-05 (succeeds regardless of skill level)
- **Automatic Failure**: Roll of 96-00 (fails regardless of skill level)

### Success Effects
Success quality consistently provides the following benefits across all systems:
- **Ordinary Success**: Base effect achieved
- **Special Success**: Enhanced effect (+1 additional step of success)
- **Critical Success**: Superior effect (+2 additional steps of success)

*Example applications: +1/+2 wounds in combat, +1/+2 progress points in tasks, +1/+2 distance in chases*

### Opposed Checks
When two characters' skills directly oppose each other:
- Both participants roll percentile dice
- Higher successful roll wins (success trumps failure; better quality trumps lesser quality)
- If both succeed with same quality, highest roll below skill wins
- If both fail, higher roll still fails worse

## STANDARD DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS

All skills and actions use this consistent scale of difficulty modifiers:

| Difficulty Level | Modifier | Example Situations |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Trivial | +40% | Tasks so simple they rarely require rolls |
| Easy | +20% | Favorable conditions, ample time, proper tools |
| Routine | +0% | Standard conditions with appropriate equipment |
| Challenging | -20% | Time pressure, improvised tools, unfavorable conditions |
| Difficult | -40% | Severe conditions, missing critical tools, under fire |
| Extreme | -60% | Nearly impossible circumstances, critically limited resources |
| Heroic | -80% | The stuff of legends, requires extraordinary effort |

*Apply only the single most significant modifier rather than stacking multiple modifiers.*

## ACTION ECONOMY

### Turn Structure
Each character gets the following actions per turn:
- **One Major Action**: Attack, use a significant skill, operate complex equipment.
- **One Movement**: Change position, adjust stance, mount/dismount
- **One Minor Action**: Draw weapon, flip switch, brief communication

### Initiative
- At the start of combat, all participants roll against REFLEX × 5
- Results determine turn order for the entire encounter:
  - Highest successful roll acts first, then around the table. 
  - Switch between clockwise and counterclockwise each encounter 
  - Ties are resolved by REFLEX score

### Defensive Actions
Characters can defend themselves using the following guidelines:
- One free defensive reaction per round (Parry, Block, Dodge, Evasive Maneuver, etc.)
- Additional defensive reactions suffer a cumulative -20% penalty
- Some epithets/specialties may grant additional defensive actions

## ATTRIBUTES

Seven core attributes, ranging from 3-18 for normal humans:

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, reaction speed
- **NERVE**: Mental composure, courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, craftiness
- **PSI**: Psychic potential (optional, only for psychic characters)

For attribute checks, multiply the attribute by 5 to get the target percentage.

## SKILL SYSTEM

### Core Skills Framework
- Skills are organized into Core Skills with Specializations
- Base percentage = (Related attribute × 2) + Skill Bonus

### Skill Ratings from Professions
- **Primary Skills**: +40% bonus
- **Secondary Skills**: +20% bonus
- **Tertiary Skills**: +10% bonus

### Using Skills Under Pressure
- **Combat**: One major skill action per round
- **Timed**: Skill attempts require defined timeframe
- **Crisis**: Skill attempts under immediate threat take -20% penalty

## DAMAGE AND WOUNDS

### Wound System
- Characters can sustain up to 3 wounds with no mechanical penalties
- Wound 4 = Incapacitation (character cannot act)
- Wound 5 = Dying

### Damage Calculation
- Each weapon has a fixed Wound Rating (1-4)
- Special Success: +1 additional wound
- Critical Success: +2 additional wounds
- No additional roll required to determine damage

### Damage Reduction
- **Cover**: Reduces wounds based on coverage quality (-1 to -3)
- **Armor**: Reduces wounds based on armor type (-1 to -3)
- **Soaking**: GRIT check can potentially reduce wounds (by 1-3 based on success quality)

## EXTENDED TASKS

### Task Complexity
- **Standard Tasks**: Single roll against appropriate skill
- **Complex Tasks**: Requires 3 successes
- **Demanding Tasks**: Requires 5 successes
- **Expert Tasks**: Requires 8 successes
- **Master Tasks**: Requires 12+ successes

### Success Counting
- **Ordinary Success**: Contributes 1 point toward completion
- **Special Success**: Contributes 2 points toward completion
- **Critical Success**: Contributes 3 points toward completion

### Timeframes
- **Combat Round** (6 seconds): One attempt per round
- **Task** (1-5 minutes): Frequent checks
- **Extended Task** (10-60 minutes): Checks at meaningful intervals
- **Prolonged Effort** (Hours to days): Checks once per significant time unit

## ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM

When a character achieves a critical success with a skill during an adventure:
1. Roll percentile dice against the current skill percentage after the adventure
2. If the roll exceeds the current percentage, improve the skill by the ones die (1-9)
3. Higher skill levels improve more slowly:
   - **Skilled (50-69%)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1-4
   - **Expert (70-89%)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1-3
   - **Master (90%+)**: Only improve on a ones die of 1

## UNIFIED VEHICLE MECHANICS

### Vehicle Statistics
- **Maneuverability**: Affects Vector Change (directional ability)
  - Sluggish (-20%), Standard (0%), Nimble (+20%), Lightning (+40%)
- **Thrust**: Affects Velocity Change (acceleration)
  - TH 1 (-20%), TH 2 (0%), TH 3 (+20%), TH 4 (+40%), TH 5 (+60%)
- **Size**: Affects durability and target profile
- **Systems**: Each has damage track from Operational to Destroyed

### Vehicle Damage
All vehicles use a 5-step damage system for major systems:
1. **Operational (0)**: Functioning normally
2. **Stressed (1)**: -20% to related skill checks
3. **Damaged (2)**: -40% to related skill checks
4. **Critical (3)**: -60% to related skill checks
5. **Disabled (4)**: System non-functional until repaired
6. **Destroyed (5)**: Requires dockyard repairs

### Vector Combat
- Opposed rolls against enemy pilot
- **Vector Change**: Directional heading maneuvers (modified by Maneuverability)
- **Velocity Change**: Thrust maneuvers (modified by Thrust)
- **Pursuit/Evasion**: Uses worse of Maneuverability or Thrust
- **Success Quality**: Affects distance (ordinary +1, special +2, critical +3)

## SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

### Zero-G Environment
- Actions requiring movement use Athletics (Zero-G) skill
- Characters without this skill suffer -40% penalty to physical actions
- High BRAWN can be a hindrance: -5% per point above 10

### Environmental Hazards
- **Vacuum**: Exposure without protection causes 1 wound per round
- **Toxic**: Requires GRIT checks at regular intervals
- **Radiation**: Causes both immediate and long-term effects
- **Extreme Temperature**: Requires appropriate gear and GRIT checks

### Social Interactions
- Social skills cannot force actions against core values
- Success creates believable reactions based on context
- Players always retain agency for their characters
- Going along with disadvantageous influence can earn advancement benefits

### Psionic Abilities
- Use PSI attribute for activation, Opposed if trying to affect another creature
- Special Success: +1 success effect
- Critical Success: +2 success effect
- Strain reduces current PSI skill rating temporarily
- Powers organized in five categories (Telepathy, ESP, Psychokinesis, etc.)
