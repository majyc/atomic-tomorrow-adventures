## Working with Manuscripts

### Content Organization
Each volume is structured as a complete book with:
- Clear chapter divisions
- Consistent formatting and style
- Cross-references between volumes
- Complete rule systems and examples

### Editing Guidelines
- Maintain the retro-futuristic tone throughout
- Use consistent terminology (e.g., "atomic fire" for nuclear power)
- Include practical examples for complex rules
- Keep formatting consistent with existing structure

### Writing Style Guidelines

Based on analysis of existing writing samples, maintain these style patterns:

#### Core Voice Characteristics
- **Conversational authority**: Explain complex mechanics with confidence but never talk down to readers
- **Collaborative guidance**: Frequent use of "you" and emphasis on group decision-making
- **Genre-conscious**: Deep SF knowledge that informs every explanation
- **Practical wisdom**: Focus on real gameplay utility, not just theoretical rules

#### Structural Patterns
- **Concept → Mechanics → Examples**: Always explain the "why" before the "how"
- **Scaffolded complexity**: Build from simple principles to complex applications
- **Exception handling**: Proactively address edge cases and variations
- **Multiple examples**: Concrete SF scenarios for every abstract concept

#### Sentence Rhythm & Flow
- **Balanced complexity**: Mix of short punchy statements with longer explanatory sentences
- **Heavy semicolon use**: Connect related concepts smoothly
- **Parenthetical asides**: Add clarification without breaking flow
- **Colon-heavy definitions**: Clear, direct explanations

#### Terminology Approach
- **Precise but accessible**: Technical terms clearly defined
- **Consistent vocabulary**: Establish and maintain game-specific terms
- **Genre authenticity**: Language that maintains SF immersion
- **Player empowerment**: Emphasize player agency and creative control

#### Instructional Philosophy
- **Empower players**: Put creative control in players' hands
- **Maintain genre integrity**: Keep retrofuturistic feel paramount
- **Encourage flexibility**: Rules as guidelines, not rigid prescriptions
- **Address practical problems**: Real gameplay challenges, not just theory
