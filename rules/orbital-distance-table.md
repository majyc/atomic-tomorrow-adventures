## SPECIAL LOCATIONS

### VENUS EQUILATERAL STATION

One of the most important communication hubs in the system, Venus Equilateral Station maintains a position 60° ahead of Venus in its orbit, forming an equilateral triangle with Venus and the Sun. This position ensures it can maintain constant communication with both Earth and Venus regardless of their orbital positions, while also having line-of-sight to Mercury and Mars for most of their orbits.

### L5 COLONY

The largest human settlement not on a planetary body, the L5 Colony orbits at the Earth-Moon Lagrange point. Home to over 100,000 people, it serves as a manufacturing center, transit hub, and showcase for space architecture. Its spinning habitats provide Earth-normal gravity for residents.

### CERES

The largest body in the Asteroid Belt, Ceres hosts the Belt's administrative headquarters and primary trade center. Its relatively mild gravity (compared to other asteroids) and substantial water resources made it an ideal location for early Belt colonization.

# ORBITAL DISTANCE & TRANSIT TABLES

## PLANETARY PROXIMITY TABLE

Roll percentile dice (d100) to determine the current relative position between any two planets. The resulting **Distance Class** represents how close or far the planets currently are in their orbits.

| d100 Roll | Position            | Distance Class | Description                     | Duration    |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 01-05     | Optimal Conjunction | A              | Closest possible approach       | 1d10/2 days |
| 06-20     | Near Approach       | B              | Highly favorable distance       | 1d10 days   |
| 21-45     | Favorable Angle     | C              | Better than average distance    | 2d10 days   |
| 46-55     | Average Position    | D              | Typical distance                | 3d10 days   |
| 56-80     | Unfavorable Angle   | E              | Worse than average distance     | 2d10 days   |
| 81-95     | Far Approach        | F              | Highly unfavorable distance     | 1d10 days   |
| 96-00     | Maximum Separation  | G              | Most distant possible alignment | 1d10/2 days |

### Distance Class Modifiers

- If checking position at the start of a campaign, roll normally
- If checking within 1 month of last check: -20 to roll if moving toward better class, +20 if moving toward worse class
- The Duration column indicates how long the planets remain in this Distance Class before moving to an adjacent class

## ABOUT CHEMICAL X PROPULSION

These transit times align reasonably closely with what physics would predict for a constant 1/3G brachistochrone trajectory (constant acceleration followed by constant deceleration). While still requiring remarkable energy efficiency compared to conventional chemical rockets, Chemical X fuel enables these journeys through its revolutionary properties:

- Creates true brachistochrone trajectories with negligible propellant consumption
- Maintains steady 1/3G acceleration without gradually decreasing as fuel mass is depleted
- Efficiently manages the extreme energies required through exotic particle interactions
- Enables ships to achieve the theoretical optimum travel time without the need for massive fuel tanks
- Provides inertial compensation to protect passengers from the physiological effects of prolonged acceleration

For more technical details, see the Chemical X specifications document.

## SPECIAL LOCATIONS

### HOSPITAL STATION

The premier medical facility in space, Hospital Station follows a carefully calculated Mars-Venus cycler orbit that guarantees it's never more than a few days' journey from any point in the inner Solar System. This massive rotating facility houses hundreds of medical specialists, cutting-edge treatment facilities, and research laboratories.

Hospital Station operates on the "fast Venus/slow Mars" cycle, meaning it makes relatively quick transits between Earth and Venus, but takes longer to reach Mars. A second Hospital Station is currently under construction that will follow the complementary "slow Venus/fast Mars" cycle, ensuring that at least one facility will always be optimally positioned for emergency response.

The standard protocol for serious medical emergencies in space is to route patients to whichever is closer: Hospital Station or a planetary medical facility. Special-purpose ambulance ships with enhanced Chemical X engines can make faster-than-standard transits to rendezvous with Hospital Station when minutes count.

| Current Position                                                          | Check Monthly |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Roll d10: 1-3: Near Venus, 4-6: In transit, 7-9: Near Mars, 0: Near Earth |               |

### TRAVEL TIMES TO HOSPITAL STATION

| From Location | Near Venus  | In Transit  | Near Mars   | Near Earth  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Earth         | 60-90 hrs   | 120-180 hrs | 160-200 hrs | 10-30 hrs   |
| Venus         | 10-30 hrs   | 90-150 hrs  | 180-220 hrs | 80-120 hrs  |
| Mars          | 180-220 hrs | 90-150 hrs  | 10-30 hrs   | 170-210 hrs |
| Ceres         | 140-180 hrs | 100-140 hrs | 90-130 hrs  | 160-200 hrs |

## COMMUNICATION WINDOW EXPLANATION

The "Comm Window" row indicates how long a clear communication window typically lasts when relay stations are optimally aligned. Outside these windows, communication requires:

1. Waiting for the next scheduled window
2. Routing through multiple relay stations (adds 1d10 hours delay)
3. Using emergency broadcast protocols (immediate but extremely limited bandwidth)

## USING THIS SYSTEM IN PLAY

1. For a new campaign or after significant time has passed, roll d100 to determine the current Distance Class between any relevant planets
2. Note the Duration (days) the planets will remain in this position
3. After that duration, planets will shift one Distance Class (A→B→C→D→E→F→G and then G→F→E→D→C→B→A)
4. Use the Distance Class to determine transit times and communication windows
5. For story purposes, consider the dramatic implications of these limitations

## STORYTELLING WITH TRANSIT & COMM LIMITATIONS

- **Message Lag**: Mercury-Earth message: "Mysterians sighted near Caloris Basin." Takes 9 light-minutes to reach Earth in Distance Class D, then Earth takes hours to mobilize a response, by which time the situation has evolved
- **Emergency Response**: Mars at maximum separation from Earth (Class G): A ship in distress must wait up to 22 minutes for their message to reach Earth, then another 22 minutes for instructions to return
- **Strategic Planning**: Venus approaching optimal conjunction with Earth: Military planners time their fleet movements to coincide with the approaching Distance Class A position, reducing travel time by 28 hours
- **Communication Blackout**: A ship behind Jupiter experiences a complete communications blackout with Earth for several hours – anything could happen during this time
- **Relay Importance**: A damaged relay station in the Belt means traders must detour to alternate communication points, adding days to transmission times

## GAME MASTER TIPS

- Use communication delays to create tension – information is always slightly outdated
- Incorporate travel times into adventure planning – what might change while characters are en route?
- Create scenarios where characters must make decisions without being able to contact headquarters
- Use relay stations as adventure locations – hubs of information, commerce, and intrigue
- Let players feel the realistic vastness of space while still enabling adventure-paced travel

Remember that these limitations create dramatic tension and interesting tactical decisions. They're a feature, not a bug!
