### ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS

| Power System        | Initial Cost | Operating Cost | Replacement  | Availability           | Regulations |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Standard Cells      | Low          | Medium         | Frequent     | Universal              | None        |
| Solar Systems       | Medium       | None           | Rare         | Anywhere with sunlight | None        |
| Chemical Generators | Medium       | High           | Occasional   | Fuel-dependent         | Minimal     |
| Atomic Systems      | Very High    | None           | Almost Never | Limited                | Strict      |

*Note: While atomic power provides virtually unlimited energy, the economic factors of high initial cost, licensing requirements, and restricted availability make conventional power systems practical alternatives for many applications. Additionally, smaller devices benefit from the simplicity and replaceability of standard cells rather than the complexity of miniaturized atomic solutions.*
