# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: PSIONIC SYSTEM

## CONCEPT

In the Atomic Tomorrow universe, psychic potential exists in all humans but usually remains dormant. Only through training, genetic predisposition, or extraordinary circumstances does this latent ability manifest. The Rhine Institute was established to identify, train, and monitor those with active psionic capabilities—both for their safety and society's.

## PSI SKILL

Psychic ability is represented by a single percentile skill:

- **Psi Skill**: The percentage chance to successfully use any psionic power

- Starting Value  (NERVE × 2) + 40% in specialty, 0% in others, -10% in opposed specialty, plus any bonuses from Origin or Background.

  

## USING PSIONIC POWERS

### BASIC PROCEDURE

1. **Determine Power Level**: Is this a Free Use (0 successes) or Powered Use (1+ successes)?
2. **Check Aura**: If using a Powered ability, note your current Aura level
3. **Make Rolls**: Roll against Psi Skill until you accumulate required successes or give up
4. **Check for Backlash**: Only on the final successful roll, if the result is higher than your Aura level, suffer backlash
5. **Update Aura**: If no backlash occurred, your Aura level becomes the final successful roll of the sequence

### FREE USES (0 SUCCESSES)

Simple, everyday applications that require no roll and don't affect Aura. These are examples - be creative!

## AURA SYSTEM

### TRACKING AURA

- **Starting Aura**: Begin each day with Aura level of 100 (maximum psychic reserves)
- **After Power Use**: If your final successful roll is equal to or under your current Aura, your Aura becomes that roll
- **Backlash Risk**: If your final successful roll is higher than your current Aura, suffer backlash and Aura remains unchanged

### BACKLASH EFFECTS

When you suffer backlash:

- Advance 1 step on the Psychic Strain track
- Aura level remains at its current level

### AURA RECOVERY

- **Natural Recovery**: Aura resets to 100 after 8 hours without using Powered abilities
- Meditation: 1 hour of concentration, make NERVE check
  - Success: Reset Aura to 100
  - Special Success: Reset Aura to 100 and next Psi roll doesn't affect Aura
  - Critical Success: Reset Aura to 100 and next two Psi rolls don't affect Aura

## PSYCHIC STRAIN TRACK

- Characters can sustain up to 3 strain with no mechanical penalties
- **4 Strain**: Psychically incapacitated (no Powered abilities until recovery)
- **5 Strain**: Unconscious from psychic overload

### STRAIN RECOVERY

- **Natural Recovery**: 1 strain recovers per day of rest
- **Meditation**: 1 hour concentration, NERVE check removes 1 strain on success
- **Empathic Healing**: Make Empathy check to transfer 1 strain from another psychic to yourself as 1 wound
- **Self-Conversion**: Make GRIT check to convert 1 of your own strain to 1 wound

## RESISTANCE

When psionic powers are used against unwilling targets, the target resists with checks against the most appropriate attribute:

- **BRAWN**: Against telekinetic forces trying to physically move or restrain
- **REFLEX**: Against powers requiring quick mental reactions or evasion
- **NERVE**: Against fear projection, emotional manipulation, or psychic pressure
- **SAVVY**: Against illusions, false sensory input, or deceptive suggestions
- **CHARM**: Against attempts to manipulate social dynamics or personal connections
- **GRIT**: Against direct mental attacks, pain induction, or psychic domination
- **GUILE**: Against mind reading, memory extraction, or deception detection

This creates an opposed roll situation:

- If the psychic succeeds and the target fails, the power works completely
- If both succeed, the higher successful roll wins
- If both fail, nothing happens (and no Aura change occurs)
- If the psychic fails and the target succeeds, the target may sense the attempt

## SUCCESS QUALITY

Psionic actions follow the same success quality system as other skills:

- **Critical Success** (doubles under skill): Enhanced effect
- **Special Success** (roll ending in 0 or 5 under skill): Enhanced effect
- **Ordinary Success** (roll under skill): Standard effect
- **Failure** (roll over skill): No effect, no Aura change
- **Special Failure** (roll ending in 0 or 5 over skill): No effect, possible detection by target
- **Critical Failure** (doubles over skill): Psionic feedback (see below)

## PSIONIC FEEDBACK

Critical failures can cause dangerous feedback effects:

- Advance 1 step on the Psychic Strain track immediately
- Roll on the Feedback Effects table for additional complications
- Aura level becomes 99 (severely depleted reserves)

### PRIMARY FUNCTIONS

- **Identification**: Testing for psionic potential among the population
- **Training**: Structured development of abilities in controlled environments
- **Certification**: Official licensing of Espers for legal practice
- **Regulation**: Oversight of psionic activity and intervention when necessary
- **Research**: Ongoing study of psionic phenomena and applications
- **Protection**: Providing resources and safe havens for psychics

### LEGAL STATUS

- Commercial purposes
- Investigation
- Mental influence
- Gathering restricted information
- Use against unwilling subjects

Licensed Espers receive credentials indicating their training level and authorized applications.

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**Dr. Sarah Voss (Mentalist, Psi Skill 65%, Current Aura: 100, Strain: 0)**

*Attempting to read the surface thoughts of a suspicious station worker*

**GM**: "This will require 1 success for basic surface thoughts. The worker isn't actively resisting, so no opposed roll needed."

**Player**: "I'll try to read what he's thinking about."

*Rolls 43 - Success*

**GM**: "You sense he's worried about something in Cargo Bay 7. Since your successful roll of 43 is under your current Aura of 100, no backlash. Your Aura is now 43."

*Later, attempting to probe deeper into his memories (3 successes needed)*

**Player**: "I want to find out what exactly he's hiding."

*First roll: 67 (success) - 1 success*, *Second roll: 26 (success) - 2 successes*,  *Third roll: 58 (success) - 3 successes*

**GM**: "You successfully probe his memories and discover he's been smuggling Rhine Institute contraband. Your final successful roll was 58, which is higher than your current Aura of 43, so you suffer backlash - advance 1 step on your Strain track. Your Aura stays at 43."

**Player**: "I want to convert that strain to a wound so I can keep using my abilities effectively."

*Rolls GRIT check: 34, success*

**GM**: "You grit your teeth and force the psychic feedback to manifest physically. Your nose starts bleeding, but your strain drops to 0."
