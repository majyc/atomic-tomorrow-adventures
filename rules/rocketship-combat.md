# ATOMIC TOMORROW ADVENTURES: ROCKETSHIP COMBAT

## PRINCIPLES

### THE CREW MAKES THE SHIP

In Atomic Tomorrow Adventures, a ship's performance in combat depends entirely on the skill and coordination of its crew. Each crew position contributes uniquely to the ship's capabilities, and the ship's systems simply enable the crew to perform their functions. Without a skilled crew, even the most advanced vessel is just an expensive coffin.

### NARRATIVE POSITIONING

Space combat emphasizes position, vectors, and tactical choices over precise movement tracking. The referee describes the relative positions of ships, while players describe their intended maneuvers. This creates a dynamic, cinematic experience without getting bogged down in complex movement calculations.

### DAMAGE TO SHIPS

Rather than tracking hit points, ships sustain system damage that accumulates until critical systems fail. This represents the increasing difficulty of keeping a damaged ship operational as systems break down and solutions become more desperate.

## SHIP STATISTICS

### MANEUVERABILITY

Represents a ship's agility and turning capability:

- **Sluggish** (Bulk freighters, colony ships): -20% to evasive maneuvers
- **Standard** (Patrol vessels, civilian craft): No modifier
- **Nimble** (Scout ships, interceptors): +20% to evasive maneuvers
- **Lightning** (Racing craft, fighter-class vessels): +40% to evasive maneuvers

### Thrust

Represents a ship's acceleration capability:

- **Underpowered** (Bulk freighters, orbital tugs): -20% to Thrust-related maneuvers
- **Standard** (Civilian vessels, patrol ships): No modifier
- **High-Thrust** (Courier ships, interceptors): +20% to Thrust-related maneuvers
- **Afterburner** (Racing craft, military pursuit vessels): +40% to Thrust-related maneuvers
- **Experimental**: +60%, but a special failure reduces it +20% until repaired, and a critical failure renders it non-operational.

### SHIP SCALE

- **Small** (1-3 crew): Personal craft, scouts, racers
- **Medium** (4-10 crew): Patrol vessels, small freighters
- **Large** (11-25 crew): Heavy freighters, military corvettes
- **Massive** (26+ crew): Battleships, colony ships, luxury liners

### SHIP SYSTEMS

Each ship has multiple critical systems, each with their own damage track:

- **Propulsion**: Engines, thrusters, and maneuvering systems
- **Weapons**: Offensive capabilities and targeting systems
- **Power**: Energy generation and distribution
- **Sensors**: Detection and information gathering
- **Life Support**: Atmosphere, temperature, and radiation protection
- **Communications**: Internal and external signal systems
- **Structure**: The physical integrity of the ship itself

Each system can take damage on a 5-step scale:

- **Operational (0)**: Functioning normally
- **Stressed (1)**: -20% to related skill checks
- **Damaged (2)**: -40% to related skill checks
- **Critical (3)**: -60% to related skill checks
- **Disabled (4)**: System non-functional until repaired
- **Destroyed (5)**: Requires dockyard repairs

When Structure reaches Disabled (4), the ship suffers catastrophic failure (hull breach, breaking apart, etc.).

### WEAPON SYSTEMS

Each weapon has the following characteristics:

- **Type**: Ray, Beam, Bolt, Missile, etc.
- **Wound Rating**: Base damage (1-4)
- **Range**: Near, Far, Distant
- **Special Properties**: Armor-piercing, area effect, EMP, etc.

## CREW STATIONS AND ACTIONS

Each station on a ship requires specific skills. Characters use their own skill ratings for these actions, but can only take one key action per turn.

### PILOT STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Evasive Maneuvers**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success allows defense against incoming attacks.
- **Attack Run**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success gives gunners +20% to hit (special success: +40%).
- **Hard Burn**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success dramatically increases Thrust at risk of 1 damage to Propulsion.
- **Threading the Needle**: Roll Piloting (Spacecraft). Success navigates hazardous terrain to lose pursuers.

### NAVIGATION STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Plot Jump**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success allows quick hyperspace calculation.
- **Tactical Advantage**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success grants +20% to pilot or gunners next round.
- **Find Cover**: Roll Navigation (Space). Success identifies celestial bodies or debris for protection.
- **Sensor Analysis**: Roll Technology (Sensors). Success reveals vulnerable systems on target ships.

### ENGINEERING STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Power Shunt**: Roll Engineering (Ship Systems). Success gives +20% to one ship system for one round.
- **Emergency Repair**: Roll Repair (Ship Repair). Success reduces damage to one system by one step.
- **Damage Control**: May act as Crew for any unmanned stations, making the Engineering (Ship Systems) roll but suffering damage on a failure, just as if they had been standing there.
- **Containment Protocol**: Roll Engineering (Ship Systems). Success prevents automatic damage escalation on any critically damaged systems that turn.

### WEAPONS STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Standard Attack**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success indicates a hit on the enemy ship.
- **Precision Shot**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons) followed by a second Combat (Ship Weapons) roll at -20%. Both must succeed to target a specific system; otherwise, the attack misses completely. A risky but potentially decisive tactic.
- **Suppressing Fire**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success forces enemy ship to maintain distance or take 1 damage.
- **Defensive Barrage**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Success gives -20% to incoming missile attacks.
- **Full Salvo**: Roll Combat (Ship Weapons). Special success required but adds +2 to weapon Destruction Rating.

### COMMUNICATIONS STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Jamming**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success gives -20% to enemy ship coordination.
- **Hail**: Roll Persuasion or Social (Diplomacy). Success can open negotiations or create distraction.
- **Decrypt**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success intercepts enemy communications, revealing their next action.
- **Distress Call**: Roll Technology (Communications). Success can summon allied ships (referee determines arrival time).

### CAPTAIN'S STATION

**Key Actions**:

- **Command Decision**: Roll Social (Leadership). Success allows the Captain to allocate incoming damage across different systems as desired. This represents tactical maneuvering to protect vital systems by exposing less critical ones. A special success completely negates 1 point of the incoming damage before allocating the rest.
- **Battle Analysis**: Roll Perception (Threat Assessment). Success reveals enemy weakness or intention.
- **Inspire Crew**: Roll Social (Leadership). Success allows one crew member to reroll a failed check.
- **Coordinate Attack**: Roll Tactics. Success allows two crew members to combine their actions for greater effect.

## COMBAT SEQUENCE

### 1. DETERMINE SITUATION

The referee describes the initial position, vectors, and any environmental factors.

### 2. INITIATIVE

Each ship's pilot rolls against their Piloting (Spacecraft) skill, modified by ship's Maneuverability.

- Highest successful roll acts first
- Failed rolls act after all successful rolls
- Ties are broken by REFLEX score

### 3. ACTIONS

In initiative order, each crew member takes one significant action, plus movement and one quick action.

### 4. ATTACKS AND DEFENSE

When a ship is attacked:

- Attacker rolls against relevant Combat skill
- If successful, defender may attempt to defend
- Defense is typically handled by the Pilot using Evasive Maneuvers
  - Successive evasive maneuver attempts in a turn suffer a cumulative -20% penalty
  - On a critical failure on the 2nd or more Evasive attempt in a turn, ship suffers 1 Structure Damage

### 5. OPPOSED RESOLUTION

If the defender attempts to evade:

- Compare quality of success (Critical > Special > Ordinary)
- If same quality, highest roll wins
- Ties favor the defender

## DAMAGE AND SYSTEM FAILURES

### WEAPON DESTRUCTION RATINGS

Space weapons have Destruction Ratings that indicate their power:

- **Light Weapons** (1): Scout ship weapons, point defense
- **Medium Weapons** (2): Standard patrol ship armament
- **Heavy Weapons** (3): Military vessel main batteries
- **Devastating Weapons** (4): Battleship armament, planet-crackers

## DAMAGE RESOLUTION SEQUENCE

When an attack hits a ship, follow this sequence:

### 1. DETERMINE INITIAL DAMAGE

- Calculate the base System Damage from the weapon's Destruction Rating
- Add bonuses for special or critical successes
- Apply reductions from armor and cover

### 2. DETERMINE TARGET SYSTEM

- **If both Precision Shot and Command Decision succeeded**: Compare the roll values (not the quality of success). The higher roll determines who controls targeting.
- **If Precision Shot won or succeeded alone**: The specific system targeted is damaged if both attack rolls succeeded.
- **If Command Decision won or succeeded alone**: The Captain allocates incoming damage across systems.

  - With a special success, 1 point of damage is negated before allocation.
  - With a critical success, 2 points of damage are negated before allocation (1 point is still negated even if a Precision Shot wins the comparison).
- **If neither Command Decision nor Precision Shot succeeded**: roll on the Hit Locations Chart

  ### HIT LOCATION CHART (d10)

  When a ship is hit and neither Command Decision nor Precision Shot has determined the target system, roll 1d10:

  | Roll | System Hit              |
  | ---- | ----------------------- |
  | 1    | Propulsion              |
  | 2    | Weapons                 |
  | 3    | Power                   |
  | 4    | Sensors                 |
  | 5    | Life Support            |
  | 6    | Communications          |
  | 7    | Structure               |
  | 8    | Cargo Systems           |
  | 9    | Med-Bay                 |
  | 0    | Crew/Passenger Quarters |

  *Note: Roll d10 when determining which system takes damage. A result of 0 represents 10 (Crew/Passenger Quarters).*

### 3. CREW STRUGGLES/APPLY FINAL DAMAGE

- Crew member controlling the damaged system makes an appropriate systems check, success quality reduces the wounds (possibly to zero) as normal.
- Mark the appropriate damage level on each affected system
- Crew takes the same amount of damage as personal wounds
- Apply the corresponding effects for damaged systems
- If any system reaches Disabled or Destroyed, announce the consequences

### 4. CHECK FOR CASCADE FAILURE

If two or more systems are at Critical or worse:

- Engineer must make a single Containment Protocol check
- Failure means additional systems begin to fail, apply one System damage to a random system. If this hits an already destroyed system, the cascade stops.  Otherwise, if causes another system to enter Critical, or a system that's already Critical to become worse, another Containment Protocol check must be made.  Repeat until the Engineer either succeeds in containing it, the new damage doesn't take a system to critical or worsen an already critical system, or the ship is destroyed.  Remember, the ship is only destroyed if the Structure is destroyed.

### EXAMPLE

The Mysterian saucer scores a hit with its Disintegrator Beam (Destruction Rating 3) and gets a special success (+1), for a total of 4 damage.

The Captain of the patrol ship has made a Command Decision with a critical success, negating 2 points of damage immediately (reducing it to 2). The Captain then allocates the remaining damage: 1 to Weapons and 1 to Communications.

The Engineer rolls for Damage Control and gets a success, reducing the total damage by 1 point. The Engineer chooses to completely negate the damage to Communications, leaving only 1 damage to Weapons.

The Weapons system takes 1 damage, moving it to "Stressed" status, giving the ship -20% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks.

### SYSTEM EFFECTS WHEN DAMAGED

Each system provides specific functions and has specific effects when damaged:

- **Propulsion**

  - **Stressed**: -20% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks
  - **Damaged**: -40% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks, maximum Thrust reduced by 25%
  - **Critical**: -60% to Piloting (Spacecraft) checks, maximum Thrust reduced by 50%
  - **Disabled**: Ship cannot maneuver, drifts on current vector
  - **Destroyed**: Requires dockyard repairs
- **Weapons**

  - **Stressed**: -20% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks
  - **Damaged**: -40% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks, weapon Destruction Rating reduced by 1
  - **Critical**: -60% to Combat (Ship Weapons) checks, only half of weapons functional

  - **Critical**: -60% to Navigation, combat beyond Near range impossible
  - **Disabled**: Blind except for visual observation through ports
  - **Destroyed**: Requires dockyard repairs
- **Life Support**

  - **Stressed**: Uncomfortable conditions, no penalties

  - **Stressed**: Static and interference, -20% to Technology (Communications)
  - **Damaged**: -40% to Technology (Communications), range reduced by 50%
  - **Critical**: -60% to Technology (Communications), ship-to-ship communication only
  - **Disabled**: No external communications, internal comms only
  - **Destroyed**: Requires dockyard repairs
- **Structure**

  - **Stressed**: Minor hull stress, no significant effect
  - **Damaged**: Small breaches sealed automatically, -20% to all actions during combat, except engineering actions.
  - **Critical**: Multiple breaches, decompression risk, -40% to all actions, except engineering actions.
  - **Disabled**: Catastrophic hull failure, ship breaking apart
  - **Destroyed**: Ship completely destroyed

### EMERGENCY REPAIRS

- **Quick Fix**: Engineer rolls Repair. Success improves a system by one damage step for the remainder of combat.
- **Jury Rig**: Engineer rolls Repair. Success temporarily restores function to a disabled system: it will work until its next Special or Critical Failure.
- **Field Repair**: Requires appropriate parts and 6 hours,  Engineer rolls Repair: -1 hour to total time for ordinary success, -2 for Special, -3 for Critial. Any success restores system to Stressed status.
- **Cannibalize**: With a successful Repair roll the Engineer can inflict 2 damage on another system to repair 1 damage on this one; special sucess reduces that to 1 damage, Critical success reduces that to 0 damage. *"Thank your lucky stars these systems are built with a lot of redundancy!"*

## DEFENSIVE MEASURES

### ARMOR PROTECTION

Ship armor directly reduces system damage inflicted:

- **Light Armor**: -1 System Damage
- **Medium Armor**: -2 System Damage
- **Heavy Armor**: -3 System Damage
- Minimum system damage inflicted is always 0
- Some weapons may have armor-piercing properties

### COVER AND POSITIONING

Taking cover behind celestial bodies or debris reduces incoming damage:

- **Partial Cover**: -1 System Damage
- **Good Cover**: -2 System Damage
- **Excellent Cover**: -3 System Damage

## CRITICAL SITUATIONS

### SYSTEM CASCADE FAILURE

Each round when two or more systems are at Critical or worse:

1. Engineer must roll Engineering (Ship Systems)
2. Success means no Cascade or the Cascade stops.
3. Failure means one additional random system takes 1 damage level
4. If this hits an already destroyed system, the cascade stops.
5. If it hits a system that becomes critical as a result, or hits an already critical system making it worse, go back to 1.

### CATASTROPHIC SHIP FAILURE

If the Structure system reaches Disabled (4):

- The ship begins breaking apart
- Life support automatically fails
- Crew has 5 minutes to reach escape pods or don vacuum suits, +1 minute per ordinary success on an Engineering check, +2 for special success, +3 for critical success.
- After the escape time minutes, the ship begins rolling a d100 every turn, and on any doubles is completely destroyed

### LAST STAND

When all seems lost, the crew can attempt one final desperate measure:

- Captain rolls a NERVE check
- Success allows coordinated action from entire crew
- Critical success grants +20% to all crew actions for this final effort
- Special success grants +10% to all crew actions for this effort

## VECTOR DYNAMICS SYSTEM

Space combat isn't just about firing weapons—it's about the complex dance of vectors, trajectories, and relative velocities. The Vector Dynamics System abstracts these concepts into a manageable framework that captures the essence of rocket maneuvering without requiring complex calculations.

### VECTOR AND VELOCITY DICE

Each pair of ships in combat uses two ten-sided dice to represent their positional relationship:

- **Vector Die (V₁)**: Represents the *difference* in directional heading and distance between ships (0-9)
- **Velocity Die (V₂)**: Represents the *difference* in Thrust between ships (0-9)

When combat begins, the referee sets these dice based on the initial situation:

- Ships passing each other at high Thrust: High Vector, High Velocity (8,8)
- Ships in similar orbits but separated: Low Vector, Medium Velocity (2,5)
- Ships on intercept course: Medium Vector, Low Velocity (4,2)
- Ships at a standoff: Medium Vector, Medium Velocity (5,5)

### INTERPRETING THE DICE

- **Vector 0, Velocity 0**: Ships are matched in course and Thrust, allowing docking or boarding
- **Vector 0, Velocity 1+**: Ships are on parallel courses but at different speeds
  - This allows ramming if desired, causing structural damage equal to the Velocity value to both ships
- **Vector + Velocity ≥ 16**: Ships break contact, combat ends unless pursuit is initiated
  - Lightning maneuverable ships can pursue at 16-17
  - Nimble ships can pursue at 16
  - Standard ships can pursue at ≤ 15
  - Sluggish ships can pursue at ≤ 14
- **Low Vector (1-3)**: Ships are in optimal firing position (+20% to weapon attacks)
- **High Vector (7-8)**: Ships are in difficult firing position (-20% to weapon attacks)
- **Low Velocity (1-3)**: Ships are moving at similar speeds, allowing sustained targeting
- **High Velocity (7-8)**: Ships are moving at significantly different speeds, making targeting difficult

### MANEUVER ACTIONS

On the Pilot's turn, they can perform maneuvers to alter the Vector and Velocity dice.  Vector and Velocity represent **relative** Thrust and velocity compared to another ship, so a roll that fails  doesn't mean the ship refused to turn or accelerate/deccelerate, only that the pilot didn't manage to outfly the opposing pilot trying to compensate for the manuever.  If the opposing ship is not resisting, for instance it's a drifting hulk or a friendly that wants to dock, failure still allows changing by 1, and there are no consequences for special or critical failure.

#### VECTOR CHANGE MANEUVER

Focuses on changing directional heading:

1. Roll Piloting (Spacecraft), modified by MANEUVERABILITY
2. Based on success level, gain Vector Maneuver Points:
   - Ordinary Success: 1 Vector Point
   - Special Success: 2 Vector Points
   - Critical Success: 3 Vector Points
3. Each point allows adjusting the Vector die by 1 in either direction

#### VELOCITY CHANGE MANEUVER

Focuses on changing relative speed:

1. Roll Piloting (Spacecraft), modified by Thrust
2. Based on success level, gain Velocity Maneuver Points:
   - Ordinary Success: 1 Velocity Point
   - Special Success: 2 Velocity Points
   - Critical Success: 3 Velocity Points
3. Each point allows adjusting the Velocity die by 1 in either direction

#### COMBINED MANEUVER

Attempts to change both vector and velocity simultaneously:

1. Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) with the worse of MANEUVERABILITY or Thrust
2. Based on success level, gain Maneuver Points:
   - Ordinary Success: 1 Point
   - Special Success: 2 Points
   - Critical Success: 3 Points
3. Distribute these points between Vector and Velocity adjustments

### SPECIAL MANEUVERS

#### PURSUIT

When an opponent's Vector + Velocity exceeds your pursuit threshold:

- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by both MANEUVERABILITY and Thrust
- Success means reducing the combined value to just below your ship's pursuit threshold
- Failure means the other ship escapes
- Each ship's maneuverability determines its pursuit threshold:
  - **Lightning**: Can pursue at Vector + Velocity ≤ 17
  - **Nimble**: Can pursue at Vector + Velocity ≤ 16
  - **Standard**: Can pursue at Vector + Velocity ≤ 15
  - **Sluggish**: Can pursue at Vector + Velocity ≤ 14

#### INTERCEPT COURSE

To rapidly close with another ship:

- Dedicate a full turn to closing distance
- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by Thrust
- Success reduces both Vector and Velocity by 1
- Special success reduces both by 2
- Critical success reduces both by 3

#### EVASIVE PATTERN

To make your ship harder to hit:

- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by MANEUVERABILITY
- Success gives attackers -20% to hit
- But own weapons suffer -20% to hit
- Lasts until your next action

#### MATCHING VELOCITY

To synchronize with another ship for boarding:

- With Vector already at 0, roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by Thrust
- Success reduces Velocity by 2
- Special success reduces Velocity by 3
- Critical success reduces Velocity to 0

#### MATCHING VECTOR

To align with another ship's course:

- With Velocity already low (≤3), roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by MANEUVERABILITY
- Success reduces Vector by 2
- Special success reduces Vector by 3
- Critical success reduces Vector to 0

#### RAMMING SPEED

With Vector at 0, deliberately impact another ship:

- Roll Piloting (Spacecraft) modified by Thrust
- Success means ramming occurs
- Both ships take Structure damage equal to current Velocity
- Ramming ship can reduce its damage by 1 on special success, by 2 on critical success

### EXAMPLE OF VECTOR DYNAMICS

**Starting Position**: A patrol ship and a Mysterian saucer begin combat with Vector 6, Velocity 7.

**Round 1**: The patrol ship's pilot performs a Vector Change Maneuver, rolls a special success (2 Maneuver Points), and reduces Vector to 4. The ships are now at Vector 4, Velocity 7.

**Round 2**: The saucer's pilot tries to escape, using 2 Maneuver Points from a special success to increase Vector to 6 and Velocity to 8. The ships are now at Vector 6, Velocity 8.

**Round 3**: The patrol ship's pilot performs an Intercept Course, rolls a critical success, and reduces both values by 3. The ships are now at Vector 3, Velocity 5, putting the patrol ship in optimal firing position (+20% to weapon attacks).

**Round 4**: The patrol ship's gunner fires with the bonus, scoring a solid hit. The saucer, damaged, attempts to synchronize for boarding to capture the patrol ship. With a special success, the saucer's pilot reduces Vector to 0. The ships are now at Vector 0, Velocity 5.

**Round 5**: The saucer attempts Matching Velocity, rolls a special success, and reduces Velocity to 2. The patrol ship, seeing the saucer's intention, decides to attempt Ramming Speed next round if boarding is attempted.

**Round 6**: The patrol ship successfully executes Ramming Speed. Both ships take 2 Structure damage, but the boarding is disrupted.
