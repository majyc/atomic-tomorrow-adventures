# PLANETARY DEFENSE FORCES

Each major world maintains modest defense forces focused primarily on:

1. **Home Defense Infrastructure** : Ground-based defense systems, early warning networks, and orbital platforms designed to protect population centers
2. **Environmental Specialists** : Units trained to leverage their planet's unique terrain:

* Venus Jungle Scouts who navigate the dense foliage
* Martian Desert Cavalry using specialized vehicles
* Mercury Solar Shield operators managing the extreme temperature differentials

1. **Disaster Response** : These forces often serve dual roles as emergency responders for natural disasters, atmospheric emergencies, or colonial crises

## CEREMONIAL & TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS

Many planetary militaries maintain ceremonial traditions despite limited combat roles:

* Colorful uniforms for planetary honor guards
* Traditional ranks and insignia dating back to early colonization
* Annual exercises and demonstrations that become public spectacles
* Friendly competition between planetary forces in Olympic-style games

## "MILITARY FAMILY" BACKGROUND IMPLICATIONS

For characters with this background:

* Traditions of service passing through generations
* Training in discipline, equipment maintenance, and teamwork
* Knowledge of defense infrastructure and protocols
* Connections to a network of veterans across settlements
* Familiarity with military bureaucracy and chain of command

This approach gives you military elements that feel appropriate for a retro-future setting where full-scale warfare isn't the primary concern. They're more like well-equipped national guards or civil defense forces - present and respected, but not dominant in the setting.

Corporate security remains appropriately low-key - uniformed guards at facilities, basic security systems, and perhaps the occasional armed transport escort, without creeping into the dystopian territory of private armies. They're the people checking badges at doors and watching security monitors, not conducting black ops.

This keeps the Space Patrol as the premier interplanetary peacekeeping force while still providing room for characters with military backgrounds and connections.
