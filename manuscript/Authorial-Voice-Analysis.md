# Atomic Tomorrow Adventures - Authorial Voice Analysis

*Analysis of manuscript voice patterns and recommendations for maintaining authentic human writing style*

Generated: August 12, 2025

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

After analyzing all four manuscript volumes against the established style samples from the writing guides, the manuscripts show **strong overall voice consistency** with your established style. However, there are several areas where Claude-isms have crept in that should be addressed to maintain the authentic, conversational authority that characterizes your best writing.

**Key Findings:**
- Voice is generally strong and consistent with your style
- Some sections exhibit obvious AI patterns that need revision
- Table-heavy sections feel mechanical vs. your natural prose flow
- The retro-futuristic tone is well-maintained throughout

---

## **VOICE CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS**

### **What's Working Well (Matching Your Style)**

1. **Conversational Authority**: Most sections successfully capture your tone of confident explanation without talking down to readers
2. **Genre Consciousness**: Excellent maintenance of retro-futuristic atmosphere and period-appropriate language
3. **Practical Focus**: Good emphasis on gameplay utility over theoretical rules
4. **Collaborative Guidance**: Frequent use of "you" and emphasis on player agency

### **Claude-isms Identified**

#### **1. EXCESSIVE PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION**
**Problem Locations:**
- Vol I, Character Creation section: Repetitive "Whether you're..." sentence patterns
- Vol III, Corporate section: Template-like company descriptions

**Example from Vol I:**
> "Whether you're Brilliant, Lucky, Two-Fisted, or Daring, your epithet represents... Whether you're a Rocket Jockey racing between worlds, a Scout mapping uncharted territories, or a Xenobiologist studying impossible life forms..."

**Your Natural Style Should Be:**
More varied sentence openings, avoiding the "Whether you're X, Y, or Z" pattern that screams AI generation.

#### **2. BULLETED LIST OVERUSE**
**Problem Locations:**
- Throughout all volumes, particularly equipment and rules sections
- Vol III has extensive bulleted corporate lists that feel mechanical

**Your Style Shows:**
- Lists embedded in natural prose flow
- Semicolon-heavy sentences that connect related concepts
- Parenthetical asides rather than bullet points

#### **3. EXACTLY THREE EXAMPLES PATTERN**
**Problem Locations:**
- Vol I: "Mars hosts bustling colonies, Venus conceals ancient secrets, O'Neill cylinders hang in space"
- Multiple sections follow the "X, Y, and Z" pattern consistently

**Fix Needed:**
Vary the number of examples (2, 4, 5) and embed them more naturally in flowing prose.

#### **4. TEMPLATED EXPLANATIONS**
**Problem Locations:**
- Equipment catalog descriptions in Vol I
- Corporate entries in Vol III feel formulaic

**Example:**
Each company description follows: Name → What they do → Their specialty → Market position

## **SPECIFIC PROBLEM PASSAGES**

### **Volume I Issues**

**Page Reference: Character Creation**
```
CURRENT (Claude-ish):
"Whether you're hunting for ancient Martian artifacts, defending a Titan colony from undersea predators, negotiating peace between Venus' squabbling tribes of autochthons, or racing to deliver vital medical supplies..."

SHOULD BE MORE LIKE:
"You might find yourself hunting Martian artifacts in the red planet's ancient ruins; perhaps you're defending some Titan colony against the things that rise from the methane seas, or trying to talk sense into those impossible Venus autochthons before they declare war on each other again. Maybe it's something as simple as a race against time to get medical supplies to Hospital Station..."
```

**Page Reference: Attribute Descriptions**
The seven attribute descriptions (BRAWN, REFLEX, etc.) each follow an identical pattern:
- Opening definition sentence
- "High [Attribute] helps you..." 
- Specific examples

This reads as artificially structured. Your natural style varies explanation approaches.

### **Volume II Issues**

**Transit Time Tables**: The extensive tables work mechanically but break the prose flow that characterizes your writing. Consider integrating key information into narrative explanations.

### **Volume III Issues**

**Corporate Descriptions**: Each follows the same template format rather than your natural varied approach to explaining organizations.

### **Volume IV Issues**

**Geographic Sections**: Some pressure zone descriptions feel overly structured with parallel "This is where..." openings.

---

## **STYLE COMPARISON WITH YOUR SAMPLES**

### **What Your Natural Style Does:**

1. **Varied Sentence Rhythm**: Mixes short punchy statements with longer explanatory ones
2. **Heavy Semicolon Use**: Connects related concepts smoothly
3. **Parenthetical Asides**: Adds clarification without breaking flow  
4. **Conversational Tangents**: Natural digressions that feel human
5. **Embedded Examples**: Rather than lists, examples flow within sentences

### **Example of Your Natural Voice (from style samples):**
> "SF can cover a mind-boggling array of settings. Here are some of the common ones: Near-future Earth, Alternate Earth, Far Past Earth..."

**vs. Claude-ish Pattern Would Be:**
> "Science fiction encompasses numerous setting possibilities. Whether you choose near-future Earth, alternate timelines, or far-past scenarios, each option offers unique storytelling opportunities..."

## **SPECIFIC REVISION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **High Priority Fixes**

1. **Break up parallel constructions** in Vol I character creation
2. **Vary corporate description formats** in Vol III  
3. **Embed more examples in flowing prose** rather than lists
4. **Add more conversational asides and tangents**

### **Medium Priority**

5. **Integrate table information** into narrative explanations where possible
6. **Vary sentence opening patterns** throughout
7. **Add more semicolon-connected sentences** to match your style

### **Voice Improvement Techniques**

#### **Instead of AI Patterns, Use:**
- **Varied sentence openings**: "You might find...", "Sometimes you'll...", "Picture this...", "The thing about..."
- **Natural digressions**: Brief tangents that feel conversational
- **Embedded qualification**: Parenthetical clarifications mid-sentence
- **Irregular examples**: 2, 4, or 5 examples instead of always 3

#### **Specific Phrase Patterns to Adopt:**
- "The thing is..." (introduces explanation)
- "Picture this scenario..." (sets up examples)  
- "Here's what you need to know..." (direct address)
- "Sometimes... other times..." (varied alternatives)

## **SECTION-BY-SECTION VOICE SCORES**

### **Volume I: Explorer's Manual**
- **Opening/Welcome**: 8/10 (good voice, minor Claude-isms)
- **Character Creation**: 6/10 (too many parallel constructions)
- **Attribute Descriptions**: 5/10 (overly templated)
- **Equipment Sections**: 7/10 (decent but could be more natural)

### **Volume II: Operations Manual**  
- **Opening**: 8/10 (good conversational tone)
- **Space Travel Rules**: 7/10 (good but table-heavy)
- **Combat Systems**: 7/10 (solid explanatory voice)

### **Volume III: GM's Dossier**
- **Opening Philosophy**: 9/10 (excellent voice match)
- **Corporate Section**: 5/10 (too templated)
- **Setting Information**: 8/10 (good narrative flow)

### **Volume IV: Venus Gazetteer**
- **Planet Overview**: 8/10 (excellent atmosphere)
- **Geographic Sections**: 6/10 (some parallel construction issues)
- **Cultural Details**: 9/10 (natural conversational tone)

## **RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Critical Voice Fixes**
1. Revise Vol I character creation to break up parallel constructions
2. Rewrite corporate descriptions in Vol III with varied approaches
3. Integrate more semicolon-connected sentences throughout

### **Phase 2: Style Polish**
4. Add more conversational asides and tangents
5. Vary example patterns (avoid always using 3)
6. Embed list information into flowing prose where possible

### **Phase 3: Voice Consistency Check**
7. Read revised sections aloud to check for natural flow
8. Compare against style samples for rhythm and tone
9. Ensure retro-futuristic language remains consistent

---

## **CONCLUSION**

The manuscripts are close to your authentic voice but need targeted revision to eliminate Claude-isms. The core tone and subject matter expertise are excellent—the issues are primarily structural patterns that make certain sections feel artificially generated rather than naturally written.

Focus first on breaking up the parallel constructions and templated descriptions, then work on adding the conversational flow that characterizes your best writing.
