## **CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION**

Creating a character in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures means building someone extraordinary—the kind of person who belongs in thrilling tales of atomic-age adventure. The system uses four columns to define who you are, where you come from, and what makes you special.

### THE FOUR-COLUMN SYSTEM

Every character combines one choice from each of four columns to create a unique concept:

**Column A: EPITHET** - What makes you extraordinary
**Column B: PROFESSION** - Your career and expertise  
**Column C: ORIGIN** - Where you're from in the solar system
**Column D: BACKGROUND** - Your upbringing and personal history

Examples of complete concepts:
- "Brilliant Xenobiologist from Venus with Academic Training"
- "Two-Fisted Space Ranger from Mars with Military Family"
- "Lucky Smuggler from the Belt with Street Urchin Background"

### GENERATING ATTRIBUTES

Before selecting your four columns, you need to determine your seven core attributes. These represent your basic capabilities and form the foundation for all your skills.

#### The Seven Attributes

- **BRAWN**: Physical strength, toughness, and athletic power
- **REFLEX**: Physical coordination, dexterity, and reaction speed  
- **NERVE**: Mental composure and courage under pressure
- **SAVVY**: Intelligence, technical knowledge, and perception
- **CHARM**: Charisma, leadership, and persuasiveness
- **GRIT**: Endurance, willpower, and mental fortitude
- **GUILE**: Cunning, deception, and craftiness

#### Attribute Generation Methods

Your Origin determines how you generate attributes:

**TERRANS**: Must use the Standard Array of 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 (distributed as you choose)

**ALL OTHER ORIGINS**: Roll 2d10 for each attribute and arrange as desired. Results below 3 become 3, and results above 18 become 18.

**TERRAN EXILES**: May choose to roll like other origins instead of using the Standard Array

### COLUMN A: EPITHET

Your epithet represents what makes you extraordinary compared to ordinary people. It grants special abilities and unique advantages that set you apart.

#### Gritty/Tough Epithets

**Grizzled** (+2 GRIT): You have 1 extra wound on your track before incapacitation (5 wounds instead of 4).

**Hard-Bitten** (+1 GRIT, +1 NERVE): +20% resistance to environmental hazards and extreme conditions.

**Battle-Scarred** (+2 NERVE): Wounds never affect your initiative rolls, regardless of penalty level.

**Steely-Eyed** (+2 NERVE): In standoffs and intimidation contests, opponents need a critical success to shake you.

**Hardboiled** (+1 GRIT, +1 GUILE): Immune to emotional manipulation and can function without sleep for 48 hours with no penalty.

**Iron-Willed** (+2 GRIT): When you would normally be incapacitated by wounds, you can continue functioning by making a GRIT check each round. However, sustaining any additional wound immediately renders you unconscious.

**Two-Fisted**: Can fight effectively with a weapon in each hand and Parry/Block one additional time per turn with no penalty.

#### Skilled/Expert Epithets

**Crack**: In your primary professional skill, any roll of doubles or ending in 0 or 5 succeeds. +10% to all other professional skills.

**Hotshot** (+10% to three skills of your choice): Your show-off maneuvers succeed more often, granting +20% when attempting flashy actions.

**Virtuoso**: One professional skill at +20% above normal maximum. Critical successes on professional skill rolls create lasting positive reputation.

**Legendary**: Your name opens doors (+20% to social interactions where your reputation matters). After adequate preparation for a task within your expertise, you can perform one flawless execution.

**Peerless** (+10% to all professional skills in your field): After studying a problem in your field for at least an hour, you can attempt solutions that would be impossible for others.

**Uncanny**: Sixth sense for danger (+20% to detect ambushes, traps, and betrayals). Animals and children instinctively trust you.

#### Adventurous Epithets

**Intrepid** (+1 NERVE, +1 REFLEX): +20% to all exploration and pathfinding rolls.

**Swashbuckling**: +20% to acrobatic combat maneuvers. Can goad opponents into making mistakes by targeting their pride.

**Bold**: After any failure, gain +20% to your next roll if attempting a different approach. Recover from setbacks twice as quickly as normal characters.

**Daring**: +20% to genuinely dangerous actions. Never suffer special or critical failures when attempting risky actions.

**Audacious**: Can attempt normally impossible stunts at -40% instead of being automatically impossible. Your daring inspires allies, granting them +10% to their next action.

**Lucky**: When you fail a roll, any result ending in a 7 allows you to reroll (you can continue rerolling as long as you keep getting 7s). +20% to games of chance and randomized situations.

#### Clever/Smart Epithets

**Brilliant** (+2 SAVVY): When examining clues or evidence, you can make correlations others miss (+20% to deduction and analysis).

**Ingenious**: Can create impromptu tools from available materials on any successful SAVVY roll. Your jury-rigged solutions ignore the first Special Failure, breaking only on Critical Failures or a second Special Failure.

**Silver-Tongued** (+2 CHARM): Persuasion attempts that succeed create lasting belief changes rather than temporary compliance.

**Enigmatic**: People find it difficult to read you (-20% to others' attempts to analyze your intentions). Strangers often confide in you, sharing secrets they normally wouldn't.

**Veteran** (+1 GRIT, +1 SAVVY): Better situational awareness; you can detect ambushes on any successful roll, not just critical success.

#### Charming Epithets

**Plucky** (+1 CHARM, +1 NERVE): In any Social Contest trying to intimidate, frighten or overawe you, you reduce the degree of success score against you by 1.

**Seductive** (+1 CHARM, +1 GUILE): In Seduction Social Contests, Opposed wraps back around to Receptive (skipping Convinced). It's still not mind control, and NPCs can want you and still betray you or refuse you out of loyalty or scruples.

**Stunning** (+2 CHARM): You command attention. You are noticed wherever you go, unless heavily disguised. Villains prefer to capture or spare you rather than mar your beauty.

**Suave** (+1 CHARM, +1 SAVVY): Special and Critical failures on Social skills become ordinary failures.

**Well-Heeled** (+1 CHARM, +1 GUILE): When failing a roll that could be resolved with money, you may immediately make a GUILE check. Success means you find a way to throw credits at the problem and turn your failure into a success—but at double the normal cost.

## **CHAPTER 2: CORE MECHANICS**

Atomic Tomorrow Adventures uses a percentile dice system that emphasizes dramatic action and pulp adventure storytelling. All actions revolve around rolling under your skill percentage, with special interpretations for particularly good or bad rolls.

### THE CORE RESOLUTION SYSTEM

**Basic Resolution**: Roll percentile dice (d100) against your skill or attribute percentage. Roll equal to or under your percentage to succeed.

**Success Quality**: The quality of your success affects the outcome:

- **Ordinary Success**: Roll is your skill percentage or less
- **Special Success**: Roll ending in 0 or 5 and your skill percentage or less
- **Critical Success**: Doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.) that are your skill percentage or less
- **Special Failure**: Roll ending in 0 or 5 and greater than your skill percentage
- **Critical Failure**: Doubles that are greater than your skill percentage

- **Automatic Success**: Roll of 01-05 (succeeds regardless of skill level)
- **Automatic Failure**: Roll of 96-00 (fails regardless of skill level)

**Success Effects**: Success quality provides consistent benefits:
- **Ordinary Success**: Base effect achieved
- **Special Success**: Enhanced effect (+1 additional step of success)
- **Critical Success**: Superior effect (+2 additional steps of success)
- **Special Failure**: Something bad happens, and -1 to your accumulated successes on an extended task
- **Critical Failure**: Something worse happens, and usually lose all your accumlated successes on an extended task

### DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS

All actions use this consistent scale of difficulty modifiers:

| Difficulty | Modifier | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Trivial** | Don't Roll | Tasks so simple it would be a surprise if you failed |
| **Easy** | +20% | Favorable conditions, ample time, proper tools |
| **Routine** | +0% | Standard conditions with appropriate equipment |
| **Challenging** | -20% | Time pressure, improvised tools, unfavorable conditions |
| **Difficult** | -40% | Severe conditions, missing critical tools, under fire |
| **Extreme** | -60% | Nearly impossible circumstances, critically limited resources |
| **Heroic** | -80% | The stuff of legends, requires extraordinary effort |

Apply only the single most significant modifier rather than stacking multiple modifiers.

### OPPOSED CHECKS

When two characters' skills directly oppose each other:
- Both participants roll percentile dice
- Higher successful roll wins (success trumps failure; better quality trumps lesser quality)
- If both succeed with same quality, highest roll wins
- If both fail, lower roll still fails worse

---

## **CHAPTER 3: SKILLS SYSTEM**

The unified skills system in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures balances natural talent with professional training, creating characters who feel both competent and specialized.

### SKILL ORGANIZATION

Skills come in two fundamental types:

**Attribute-Based Skills**: Skills directly tied to a specific attribute.
- **Untrained**: Attribute × 2
- **Core Value** = (Attribute × 2) + 5%
- Example: Athletics is based on BRAWN

**FLEX Skills**: Skills representing knowledge that relies more on training than raw talent
- **Untrained**: 10%
- **Core Value** = 25% (equivalent to having an attribute of 10)
- Example: Academics represents scholarly knowledge independent of natural aptitude. It's not that being smart (high Savvy) doesn't help you be a historian, say, but being smart and well-trained as a historian doesn't automatically make you good at other academic specialties such as mathematics or medicine.  To be good in a FLEX skill means being trained and having experience in the field.

Most of the time, any character can attempt any action even if they have no relevant training.  So what if you've never flown a rocket ship before, there's always a chance!

### PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

Your profession provides additional training in specific skills:
- **Primary Professional Bonus**: +40%
- **Secondary Professional Bonus**: +20%  
- **Tertiary Professional Bonus**: +10%

**Final Skill = Core Value + Professional Bonus**

### SKILL CALCULATION EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Navigation (Space)**
- Character with SAVVY 14
- Navigation as Secondary Professional skill
- Core Skill: (14 × 2) + 5% = 31%
- With Secondary Professional Bonus: 31% + 20% = 51%

**Example 2: Academics (History)**
- FLEX skill with no special attribute influence  
- Academics as Primary Professional skill
- Core Skill: 25%
- With Primary Professional Bonus: 25% + 40% = 65%

If you have training, you use the most relevant specialized skill, or if none are applicable use the core value of your specialty.  E.g. If you have Engineering (Ships Systems) at 71% from a Core skill of 31 (Savvy 13 x 2 + 5) + 40 for your primary profession and you're called on to do some engineering on some medical equipment since it's outside of your specialty you'd roll vs your Core Value 31 instead of your full value of 71.

### SKILL ADVANCEMENT

Mark a skill for potential advancement whenever you:
1. Roll a critical success with the skill
2. Succeed at a particularly difficult or dramatic use of the skill  (Difficult or worse penalty)
3. Succeed with the skill in a life-threatening or high-stakes situation (failure means death for you or another)

At the end of the adventure:
1. For each marked skill, roll d100 against your current percentage
2. If you fail the roll (roll above your current percentage), you've found room for improvement
3. Increase the skill by:
   - **Beginner (<50%)**: improve by 10%
   - **Skilled (50-69%)**: improve by 3%
   - **Expert (70-89%)**: improve by 2%
   - **Master (90%+)**: improve by 1%

---

## **CHAPTER 4: TASK RESOLUTION**

This system handles non-combat challenges that characters face, from bypassing security systems to performing emergency surgery or deciphering alien artifacts.

### PRINCIPLES OF TASK RESOLUTION

1. **Roll When It Matters**: Only roll when success is uncertain and failure has consequences
2. **Direct Contribution**: All participants contribute directly to tasks rather than providing abstract bonuses
3. **Flexible Timeframes**: Task difficulty and duration are separate considerations
4. **Action Under Pressure**: Tasks can be performed during combat or other time-sensitive situations

### TASK DIFFICULTY CATEGORIES

**Standard Tasks**: Single roll against appropriate skill (1 success)
- Examples: Hot-wiring a vehicle, treating a minor injury, identifying a strange mineral

**Complex Tasks**: Requires 3 successes
- Examples: Bypassing security systems, performing field surgery, repairing damaged equipment

**Demanding Tasks**: Requires 5 successes
- Examples: Deciphering alien code, disarming complex explosive, hacking a military computer

**Expert Tasks**: Requires 8 successes
- Examples: Performing delicate brain surgery, reconstructing ancient technology, navigating a treacherous asteroid field

**Master Tasks**: Requires 12+ successes
- Examples: Repairing a severely damaged spacecraft, deciphering an entire alien language, terraforming a small region

### SUCCESS COUNTING

Success quality contributes different amounts toward task completion:
- **Ordinary Success**: Contributes 1 point toward completion
- **Special Success** (successful roll ending in 0 or 5): Contributes 2 points toward completion
- **Critical Success** (doubles under skill percentage): Contributes 3 points toward completion
- **Special Failure** (failed roll ending in 0 or 5): Subtract 1 success from extended task
- **Critical Failure** (doubles over skill percentage): Lose accumulated successes from extended task. GM might rule task is now impossible (you broke it).

### TIMEFRAMES

**Combat Round (6 seconds)**: One attempt per round
- Examples: Bypassing a blast door during combat, stabilizing a critically wounded comrade

**Standard Task (1-5 minutes)**: Frequent checks (every minute)
- Examples: Hot-wiring a vehicle, picking a standard lock

**Extended Task (10-60 minutes)**: Checks at meaningful intervals
- Examples: Performing surgery, repairing ship systems, interrogating a captive

**Prolonged Effort (Hours to days)**: Checks once per significant time unit
- Examples: Surveying a crash site, researching ancient artifacts, constructing a makeshift shelter

### TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION

**Primary and Secondary Contributors**: For tasks where one person clearly leads while others assist:
- The primary operator makes normal skill rolls
- Assistants make skill rolls at -20%
- Assistants contribute a maximum of 1 success per roll, regardless of quality

**Distributed Effort**: For tasks where multiple people can contribute equally:
- All participants make normal skill rolls
- All successes count normally (1 for ordinary, 2 for special, 3 for critical)

### COMPLICATIONS AND SETBACKS

**Minor Setback**: On a special failure (failed roll ending in 0 or 5), lose 1 previously accumulated success

**Major Setback**: On a critical failure (doubles that fail), lose all accumulated successes and must restart the task

---

## **CHAPTER 5: COMBAT SYSTEM**

Combat in Atomic Tomorrow Adventures emphasizes dramatic action, heroic stunts, and the cinematic flow of pulp adventure stories. The system keeps things fast-paced while providing tactical options for clever players.

### INITIATIVE AND TURN SEQUENCE

1. **Roll Initiative**: Roll percentile dice against REFLEX × 5
2. **Turn Order**: Highest successful roll acts first for the duration of this combat, then go around the table; alternate between clockwise and counter-clockwise each combat to keep it from getting stale
4. **Ties**: Resolved by higher REFLEX score

### ACTION ECONOMY

Each round, a character can:
- Take one significant action (attack, use device, complex skill use)
- Move within their zone or towards an adjacent zone
- Perform one quick action (draw weapon, flip switch, brief communication)

### POSITIONING

Combat uses abstract positioning with four ranges:
- **Engaged**: Hand-to-hand combat distance
- **Near**: Within same general area (pistol range)
- **Far**: Separate area but still within sight (rifle range). It requires 3 moves to go from Near to Far or vice-versa.
- **Distant**: Requires significant movement to reach (difficult shot). It requires another 3 moves to go from Far to Distant, and vice-versa.

### ATTACK SEQUENCE

1. Attacker rolls against appropriate Combat skill (Unarmed, Melee, Ranged)
2. If attack fails, no effect occurs
3. If attack succeeds, defender may choose to defend or take the hit

### DEFENSE OPTIONS

**Parry**: Requires a weapon or Unarmed Combat skill, only vs. melee or unarmed attacks

**Block**: Requires a shield, +20% to the roll. Can only block melee attacks once per turn, can block missiles as many times as needed

**Dodge**: Can be used against any attack, but -20% vs. melee attacks

**Defense Limitations**: The first defensive action per turn is at full percentage, each subsequent defensive action suffers a cumulative -20% penalty.

### OPPOSED RESOLUTION

When defense is attempted:
1. Compare quality of success (Critical > Special > Ordinary)
2. If same quality, highest roll wins
3. Ties favor the defender

### DAMAGE AND WOUNDS

**Weapon Damage**: Each weapon has a fixed Wound Rating (1-4) with no additional roll required.

**Wound Determination**:
- Base Wounds: Weapon's Wound Rating
- Special Success attack: Adds 1 additional wound  
- Critical Success attack: Adds wounds equal to half the tens digit (round down)
- These bonuses stack (a critical special success adds both bonuses)

**Damage Soaking**: Defender rolls against GRIT × (5 - current wounds)
- Critical Success: Reduce wounds by 3
- Special Success: Reduce wounds by 2
- Ordinary Success: Reduce wounds by 1
- Failure: No reduction

### WOUND EFFECTS

Characters can sustain up to 5 wounds:
- **0-3 Wounds**: Fully functional in combat
- **4 Wounds**: Incapacitated but conscious
- **5 Wounds**: Dying

**Incapacitation**: At 4 Wounds, a character can attempt a GRIT × 1 roll to perform a single action. Success allows one normal action despite wounds. Critical success allows the action with no penalties.

**Last Stand**: A character at 5 Wounds can attempt one final heroic act with a NERVE check. Success allows one final action before collapsing. Critical success allows the action at no penalty and stabilizes at 4 Wounds.

### PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

**Cover Protection** (reduces weapon's Wound Rating):
- Partial Cover: -1 Wound
- Good Cover: -2 Wounds  
- Excellent Cover: -3 Wounds

**Armor Protection** (reduces incoming wounds):
- Light Armor: -1 Wound
- Medium Armor: -2 Wounds
- Heavy Armor: -3 Wounds

Some weapons may have armor-piercing properties that ignore some or all armor protection.

**Environmental Positioning:**

Flanking, back-stabbing, attacking from a higher position, attacking with surprise, and any other situational modifiers should be decided by the GM on the fly, and if it's reasonable either the target should suffer a modifier to Defense or perhaps be unable to actively defend at all. In other cases one of the standard modifiers (-20, -40, etc.) should be applied. Often there should be an opposed role, say of Guile vs. Savvy, to check if the character has been sneaky enough to earn the bonus.

### SUPER-SIMPLE COMBAT MANEUVERS

This elegant system allows for tactical depth without additional complexity. With any successful attack, the attacker can declare a desired effect instead of doing damage.

**Super Simple Mechanic:**

1. Attacker declares desired effect along with attack
2. If attack succeeds, defender chooses:
   - Accept the declared effect (disarm, knockdown, push, etc.)
   - Refuse and take normal damage instead

**Critical Success Enhancement:**
If the attack is a critical success, the defender must accept the declared effect and cannot choose to take damage instead.

**Common Maneuvers:**

- **Disarm**: Target drops weapon or item
- **Trip/Knockdown**: Target falls prone
- **Push**: Target moves back one zone or position
- **Pin**: Target cannot move until they break free
- **Stun**: Target suffers -20% to next action
- **Grab Item**: Snatch an item from target
- **Distract**: Target cannot use defensive actions next round
- **Reposition**: Force target to move to specific position in zone

**Tactical Considerations:**

- Clever players can use maneuvers to set up advantageous situations
- NPCs will generally accept the effect if it's less harmful than taking a wound
- Some opponents may have specific vulnerabilities that make certain maneuvers more effective

### SPECIAL WEAPON EFFECTS

Many weapons have effects that trigger on special or critical success. These effects represent the weapon's technology interacting with the target in unexpected or particularly effective ways.

| Weapon Type | Special Success Effect |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Laser** | Negates one additional level of armor reduction |
| **Plasma** | Area effect damage (adjacent targets take 1 wound) |
| **Sonic** | Target disoriented (-20% to next action) |
| **Cryo** | Target movement reduced by half |
| **Thermal** | Target catches fire (1 wound per round until extinguished) |
| **Ballistic** | Knockback effect (target moves back one position) |
| **Explosive** | Wider area effect |
| **Kinetic** | Target knocked prone |
| **Vibro** | Negates one additional level of armor reduction |
| **Impact** | Target stunned for 1 round |

### WEAPON PROPERTIES

Beyond their basic wound ratings, weapons possess various properties that affect their utility and tactical application.

| Property | Effect | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Armor Piercing** | Negates 1-3 levels of armor wound reduction | Usually found on military or specialized weapons |
| **Area Effect** | Affects multiple targets in same zone | May require special ammunition or power |
| **Concealable** | +20% to hide the weapon | Usually smaller and less powerful |
| **Non-lethal** | Can stun or incapacitate without causing wounds | Common in law enforcement weapons |
| **Reach** | Can attack from slightly beyond engaged range | Provides initiative advantage in first round of melee |
| **Silent** | Makes no noise when used | +20% to Stealth if used as part of a stealthy action |

### SPECIAL COMBAT SITUATIONS

Combat in the atomic age rarely takes place in ideal conditions. Space battles occur in zero gravity, while planetary adventures expose characters to hostile environments that affect tactical considerations.

**Zero-G Combat** presents unique challenges where traditional movement doesn't apply. Actions requiring movement use Athletics (Zero-G) skill instead of normal movement. Characters without this specialized training suffer a -40% penalty to physical actions, while those with high BRAWN find their strength working against them in weightlessness, suffering -5% per point of BRAWN above 10.

**Environmental Hazards** can quickly turn any encounter deadly. Vacuum exposure without protection causes 1 wound per round as the body struggles with decompression. Toxic atmospheres require regular GRIT checks to avoid poisoning, while radiation causes both immediate damage and long-term health effects. Extreme temperatures, whether the frozen void of space or the scorching surface of Mercury, require appropriate protective gear and GRIT checks to maintain effectiveness.

### AMMUNITION AND POWER

The atomic age has brought remarkable advances in portable power, but even the most sophisticated weapons have practical limitations that affect tactical planning.

| Weapon Class | Energy Weapons | Conventional Weapons |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Light Weapons** | 20 shots per power cell | 8-12 rounds per magazine |
| **Medium Weapons** | 15 shots per power cell | 15-30 rounds per magazine |
| **Heavy Weapons** | 10 shots per power cell | 5-10 rounds per magazine |
| **Specialized Weapons** | 5-8 shots per power cell | Varies by design |

Energy weapons offer the advantage of standardized power cells that can often be recharged at atomic power stations, while conventional weapons rely on manufactured ammunition that may be scarce in frontier regions.

### COMBAT EXAMPLE

**Situation**: Captain Steel faces off against a Mysterion agent in the corridors of an asteroid mining station.

**Round 1 - Initiative**: 
- Captain Steel (REFLEX 15): Rolls 42 vs 75% - Success, acts first
- Mysterion Agent: Rolls 88 vs 60% - Fails, acts second

**Captain Steel's Turn**: Draws his Blast Pistol (quick action) and fires at the agent (major action)
- Combat (Pistols) 65%: Rolls 33 - Critical Success!
- Blast Pistol normally does 2 wounds, +1 for critical (half of 3), total 3 wounds

**Mysterion Agent's Defense**: Attempts to Dodge
- Athletics (Acrobatics) 50%: Rolls 67 - Fails
- Takes full 3 wounds, reducing him to 1 wound remaining

**Mysterion Agent's Turn**: Returns fire with his Disintegrator
- Combat (Energy Weapons) 70%: Rolls 25 - Special Success!
- Disintegrator does 3 wounds +1 for special = 4 wounds total

**Captain Steel's Defense**: Attempts to dive behind cover (Dodge)
- Athletics (Acrobatics) 55%: Rolls 44 - Success
- But Mysterion's special success beats Steel's ordinary success
- Steel takes 4 wounds and is incapacitated!

**Captain Steel's Last Stand**: At 4 wounds, attempts GRIT check to stay active
- GRIT 14 × 1 = 14%: Rolls 09 - Success!
- Can take one more action despite being incapacitated

This example shows how the quality of success matters in opposed combat, and how even tough heroes can be brought down by a good shot—but might still have one last chance to save the day!

## **CHAPTER 6: EQUIPMENT & GEAR**

The atomic age has brought incredible technological advances to humanity. From ray guns that harness stellar energy to rocket suits that let you soar between planets, the equipment of 2025 combines scientific wonder with atomic-age style.

### WEAPON CLASSIFICATIONS

Weapons in the atomic age are classified by several characteristics that determine their effectiveness and utility. The **Type** indicates whether the weapon is designed for melee or ranged combat, while the **Class** (Light, Medium, or Heavy) reflects its size and power requirements. The **Wound Rating** (1-4) represents the base wounds inflicted, and **Special Properties** cover unique effects or tactical advantages.

Understanding wound ratings helps players choose appropriate weaponry for their missions. Rating 1 weapons include minor implements like improvised tools and small caliber firearms. Rating 2 represents standard personal weapons and common military arms that form the backbone of most arsenals. Rating 3 covers heavy military weapons and specialized combat tools requiring significant training. Rating 4 weapons are typically vehicle-mounted or extremely powerful devices that can devastate entire areas.

### RANGED WEAPONS

The development of portable atomic power has revolutionized ranged weaponry, creating everything from concealable hold-out blasters to devastating disintegrator rifles.

| Weapon | Class | Range | Special Properties |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Hold-out Blaster** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Concealable (+20% to hide) |
| **Dart Pistol** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Silent, can deliver toxins |
| **Stunner** | Light (WR 1) | Near | Non-lethal, GRIT check or stunned |
| **Signal Pistol** | Light (WR 1) | Far | Illuminates area, can start fires |
| **Blast Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Standard sidearm |
| **Laser Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Negates 1 armor level, silent |
| **Gauss Pistol** | Medium (WR 2) | Near/Far | Special: penetrates partial cover |
| **Sonic Disruptor** | Medium (WR 2) | Near | Area effect, ignores partial cover |
| **Thermal Projector** | Medium (WR 2) | Near | Special: target catches fire |
| **Blast Rifle** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far/Distant | Military standard |
| **Laser Rifle** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far/Distant | Negates 1 armor level, silent |
| **Plasma Caster** | Heavy (WR 3) | Far | Special: damages adjacent targets |
| **Disintegrator** | Heavy (WR 3) | Near/Far | Critical: +1 extra wound |

### MELEE WEAPONS

While ranged weapons dominate the battlefield, close combat remains essential when ammunition runs low or stealth demands silence. Atomic-age melee weapons combine traditional blade work with exotic technologies.

| Weapon | Class | Special Properties |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Combat Knife** | Light (WR 1) | Concealable (+20% to hide) |
| **Shock Gloves** | Light (WR 1) | Special: target stunned for 1 round |
| **Vibro-dagger** | Light (WR 1) | Negates 1 level of armor reduction |
| **Vibro-blade** | Medium (WR 2) | Negates 1 level of armor reduction |
| **Shock Baton** | Medium (WR 2) | Special: GRIT check or stunned |
| **Force Blade** | Medium (WR 2) | Negates 2 armor levels, requires power |
| **Vibro-axe** | Heavy (WR 3) | Special: +1 additional wound |
| **Power Hammer** | Heavy (WR 3) | Special: knocks target prone |
| **Force Sword** | Heavy (WR 3) | Negates 2 armor levels, parries energy weapons |

### STANDARD KITS

## **CHAPTER 7: MEDICAL SYSTEM**

Medical treatment in the atomic age involves both miraculous cures and dangerous side effects. Every treatment decision carries risk and requires careful consideration of immediate needs versus long-term consequences.

### WOUND MECHANICS

Characters track wounds rather than hit points. Each wound represents a significant injury that affects your capabilities:

- **0-3 Wounds**: Fully functional
- **4 Wounds**: Incapacitated but conscious  
- **5 Wounds**: Dying

### BASIC TREATMENTS

**Emergency Medikit**: Heals 1 wound with successful Medicine check. Standard medical equipment for field treatment.

**Z-Ray Emergency Patches**: Advanced healing technology that can heal 2 wounds but carries a 10% chance of minor mutation.

**Stimulants**: Various drugs that can mask wound penalties or provide temporary enhanced performance, each with specific side effects and duration.

### MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS

When using advanced treatments, complications can occur based on special or critical failures:
- **Special Failures** (roll ending in 0 or 5): Standard complication occurs
- **Critical Failures** (doubles): Severe complication occurs  
- Both together: Critical complication requiring specialized treatment

### TREATMENT PHILOSOPHY

The medical system creates meaningful choices through treatment tradeoffs. When treating patients, doctors must balance immediate effectiveness against side effects and long-term complications, considering current circumstances and available facilities.

## **CHAPTER 8: PSIONICS**

Some humans have developed mental abilities beyond the normal range, perhaps due to cosmic ray exposure or evolutionary advancement. These psychic powers, or "psionics," are studied and regulated by the Rhine Institute.

### PSI SKILL

All psionic abilities use the Psi skill based on NERVE. Unlike other skills, using psionics depletes your Aura and can cause mental strain.

### THE FIVE DISCIPLINES

**Telepathy**: Reading and communicating through minds
- Basic: Sense surface thoughts, send simple messages
- Advanced: Deep mind reading, complex mental communication

**Telekinesis**: Moving objects with mental force  
- Basic: Lift small objects, apply gentle pressure
- Advanced: Manipulate heavy objects, create force barriers

**Precognition**: Perceiving possible futures
- Basic: Sense immediate danger, glimpse likely outcomes
- Advanced: Detailed future visions, probability manipulation

**Empathy**: Sensing and influencing emotions
- Basic: Read emotional states, project calm
- Advanced: Emotional manipulation, fear or courage inspiration

**Teleportation**: Instantaneous movement through space
- Basic: Short-range jumps, emergency escape
- Advanced: Long-distance travel, group teleportation

### AURA AND STRAIN

Each psychic has an Aura rating representing their mental energy reserves. Using psionics depletes Aura, and attempting to use powers when your Aura is too low causes Strain—mental feedback that can be dangerous or even deadly.

### LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The Rhine Institute registers and monitors psychics, providing training and legal protection in exchange for documentation and occasional service. Unregistered psychics face legal difficulties but avoid institutional oversight.
