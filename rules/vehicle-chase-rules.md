## EXAMPLE CHASE SEQUENCE

**Referee**: "The silver Mysterian saucer rises from behind the Luna City dome, pursuing your Quantum Cyclone Hyperbike. You're at distance 8 as you tear across the lunar surface. The chase begins!"

*Initiative rolls determine the player goes first*

**Player**: "I'll take a Dangerous Maneuver through the mining complex ahead!"

**Referee**: *Rolls d10, gets 3* "You see a narrow gap between two massive ore processors. It's just wide enough for your bike if you time it right!"

**Player**: *Rolls 25 on Vehicle Operation (75%) - a special success* "I gun the engine and thread perfectly through the gap!"

**Referee**: "Your bike rockets through the narrow passage with incredible precision! Base distance +4, plus +2 for special success. The Mysterian saucer is now at distance 14, almost out of sight!"

**Referee (for Mysterian)**: "The saucer takes a Suicidal Maneuver to close the gap!"

*Rolls d10, gets 8*

"The Mysterian craft plunges directly through an experimental transport hub where prototype vehicles are being tested! Robotic test machines and experimental craft zoom in unpredictable patterns!"

*Rolls for the Mysterian - success*

"The saucer weaves between experimental vehicles with impossible precision. Base distance -7 from you, bringing it to distance 7!"

**Player**: "I'll use my Dimensional Phase Shifter to pass through the crashed solar harvester blocking the path ahead!"

**Referee**: "Your bike shimmers with blue energy as you pass ghostlike through the wreckage! What's your next move?"

**Player**: "Now I'll take a Reckless Maneuver to extend my lead!"

**Referee**: *Rolls d10, gets 5* "You're approaching the atomic testing zone that powers Luna City. Warning sirens blare as radiation sensors detect your approach. Radiation fields shimmer visibly in the air!"

**Player**: *Rolls 94 on Vehicle Operation (75% - 40% = 35%) - failure* "My bike's radiation shielding fails as I navigate through!"

**Referee**: "Your controls flicker and your engine sputters! You lose 3 distance due to your failed Reckless Maneuver. The saucer closes to distance 4, within weapons range! Let's see what happens to your bike..."

*Rolls on Consequences Table, gets 73*

"Your bike suffers a major collision with a radiation sensor array! Your structure takes 2 damage, making it Damaged. Your cockpit integrity is compromised and the air begins to thin - you're at -20% to all actions until repairs can be made!"

**Player**: "I'm going to risk using my Dimensional Phase Shifter again to escape through that collapsed tunnel ahead!"

**Referee**: "A risky move with an already damaged bike! Roll your Vehicle Operation."

**Player**: *Rolls 88 - critical failure with doubles*

**Referee**: "Your damaged bike's systems can't handle the strain! The Phase Shifter goes into catastrophic failure!"

*Rolls d10 on Catastrophic Results Table, gets 7 - Special Catastrophe I for Dimensional Phase Shifter*

"The Phase Shifter malfunctions spectacularly! Your bike becomes intangible but you don't - you're suddenly ejected through the handlebars at high speed while your bike continues forward as a ghostly outline! Roll REFLEX×5 to see if you can activate your emergency vacuum suit before you hit the lunar surface!"

*The chase takes an unexpected turn as the player must now deal with the consequences of technology gone haywire...*

## DESIGN NOTES

This system creates cinematic chases with:

1. **Streamlined Dice** - Using d10 for hazard selection and percentile dice only when both digits are meaningful
2. **Dual-Purpose Hazards** - Each hazard works for ground, air, or water with thematic adaptation
3. **Escalating Difficulty** - Risk levels increase consequences without requiring separate tables
4. **Variable Outcomes** - Success quality and mechanical certainty create dramatic turning points
5. **Atomic Age Flavor** - Vehicles and hazards reflect retro-futuristic technology and dangers

The system generates vivid chase sequences that capture the spirit of atomic age pulp adventures while offering meaningful tactical choices to players without excessive complexity.
