# Atomic Tomorrow Adventures: Core Skills System

## Core Skills Framework

This system organizes character capabilities into **Core Skills** with **Specializations**. When a profession grants a specialization, characters gain both the specialization at the listed value and the core skill at 20% lower, or the Flex skill at a flat 20%.

**Example:** An Engineer with Specialization: Atomic +50% would have Engineering (core skill) at +30%.  An Academic with specialization History at +40% would have Academics at 20%

## Skill Rating Principles

This system maintains the profession-based skill progression (primary +40%, secondary +20%, tertiary +10%) while introducing core skills and specializations. Here's how it works:

### Specialization vs. Core Relationship

When a profession grants a specialization, the character automatically gains the associated core or flex skill at a lower rating:

- **Specialization at +40%** → Core skill at +20%
- **Specialization at +20%** → Core skill at +10%
- **Specialization at +10%** → Core skill at +5% (attribute-only)
- **Flex Skill** → automatically 20%

### Different Profession Patterns

Professions can grant skills in several patterns:

1. **Specialization-Heavy**: Primary: Core+Specialization, Secondary: Core+Specialization, Tertiary: Core+Specialization

   - Example: *Engineer with Engineering (Atomic) +40%, Engineering (Ships Systems) +20%, Engineering (Jury Rig) +10%*
   - Resulting in Engineering (core) at +20%
2. **Core-Heavy**: Primary: Core+Specialization, Secondary: Core skill, Tertiary: Different Core skill

   - Example: *Pilot with Piloting (Spacecraft) +40%, Navigation +20%, Technology +10%*
   - Resulting in Piloting at +20%, Navigation at +20%, and Technology at +10%
3. **Mixed Approach**: Primary: Core+Specialization, Secondary: FLEX skill, Tertiary: Core+Specialization

   - Example: *Scientist with Science (Physics) +40%, Academics +20%, Engineering (Experimental) +10%*

### Default Attempts

Characters can attempt any reasonable skill without training:

- For attribute-linked skills: Roll against (Attribute × 2)
- For FLEX skills: Roll against a flat 20%

### Skill Formulas

- **Attribute-Linked Core Skill**: (Attribute × 2) + Core Skill Bonus
- **Attribute-Linked Specialization**: (Attribute × 2) + Specialization Bonus
- **FLEX Skill**: Core Skill Bonus + 20%
- **FLEX Specialization**: Specialization Bonus + 20%

### Using Skills Without Specialization

When attempting an action covered by a specialization you don't have, use the core skill rating.

### Attribute-Independent Skills

Some skills represent broad knowledge bases that don't clearly align with a single attribute. These are marked with (FLEX) and are completely attribute-independent. They receive a +20% bonus to compensate for not having an attribute modifier, making them function as if they had a governing attribute of 10.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Converting Profession Skills

When updating profession entries, convert specific skills to appropriate core skills with specializations:

**Old Format:**

- Skills: Nuclear Physics (SAVVY) +40%, Radiation Safety (SAVVY) +20%, Engineering (SAVVY) +10%, Mathematics (SAVVY) +10%

**New Format:**

- Skills: Science (Physics) +40%, Engineering (Atomic) +20%, Academics (Mathematics) +10%, Technology (Radiation Systems) +10%

### Using FLEX Skills

FLEX skills operate independently of attributes, using only their skill percentage for checks. This reflects how some skills rely more on training and accumulated learning than on natural aptitude.

- An artist with Art (sculpture) +60% rolls against 60% regardless of their attributes
- A trader with Trade (Market Analysis) +50% rolls against 50% regardless of their attributes
- An academic with Academics (History) +40% rolls against 40% regardless of their attributes

### Supporting Specializations

When one specialization would logically support another, grant a +10% bonus:

- Using Navigation (Space) to support Piloting (Spacecraft)
- Using Medicine (Emergency) to support Medicine (Surgery)
- Using Science (Chemistry) to support Demolitions
